/**
 * Home.
 *
 * Not a feed. A feed answers "what did the people I follow post"; Home answers
 * "what should I look at now", and those are different questions with different
 * ingredients.
 *
 * **SimpMusic's Home, around this app's bands** — the owner's direction
 * (2026-10-22): its glow "with the same effect and size", "their exact top
 * bar", and its tabs with moods. Read from its source, not its screens:
 *
 * - **The top bar is `<HomeHeader>`**: All, Mood and Genre, Create and
 *   Settings on one row, fixed over the page, clear at the top and the
 *   page's colour once the page is under it. The reference puts the avatar
 *   there too; the owner had it brought back onto the page (2026-10-22) as
 *   the "Welcome back" row it was — on All, with the bell beside the name —
 *   so the chips have the row to themselves.
 * - **The glow is `<HomeGlow>`**: the background of the page's first block —
 *   the bar's room and the first section — and 140dp past it, scrolling with
 *   the page. Its colour is the dominant colour of the first game in the first
 *   section — "Games for you", or a mood's or a genre's first shelf — times 0.5, as the
 *   reference takes it from its first shelf's first song (`lib/home-glow`).
 *   It replaced the soft light in the top-left corner (`<AmbientLight>`).
 *   **Its length is the first block's**, which on All is the greeting and
 *   Surprise Me and stops there — see `leadHeight`.
 * - **Mood and Genre swap the page.** All is this page's own bands, below; a
 *   mood or a genre is its feed (`<MoodLead>`, `<MoodBody>`, `lib/games/moods`
 *   and `genre-feed` — what the reference asks YouTube for, written as IGDB
 *   clauses). Every view ends on "Let's pick a mood for you" (`<MoodTiles>`),
 *   the reference's moods-and-genres grid — its *search* screen's blocks, at
 *   the owner's direction (2026-10-22) — before the footer.
 *
 * **All is four bands, and the order is the argument.** The page opens on *you*
 * and widens outward — what you might play, what people played, what came out,
 * what happened. Every band is a different question; none of them is a second
 * helping of the one above it.
 *
 *   Games for you     — from your own logs, via IGDB similarity
 *   New from friends  — what your circle scored and wrote about   (Postgres)
 *   Releases          — just out, and what is next                (IGDB)
 *   Latest news       — what happened                             (RSS)
 *   Latest events     — the last three showcases that finished    (IGDB)
 *
 * **The first three are rows of games**: a one-line heading on the page over
 * small covers — the shape of the sections on Letterboxd's home, the owner's
 * reference (2026-10-09), without the cards the reference draws them in (the
 * owner had those removed). The news stands under its own heading the same way.
 *
 * **"New from friends" is where the review cards were.** The band was a stack
 * of `<LogCard>`s — your circle's, then everyone's under a rule. The owner
 * replaced it with the reference's row of that name: covers, and under each a
 * face, a name and a score. When the people you follow have logged nothing —
 * or you follow nobody — the same row is headed "New on GameLog" and shows
 * everyone's; it is never both, and never blended (`getHomeActivity`). The
 * review card is still every *list* of reviews in the app; Home no longer has
 * one.
 *
 * It used to be seven. Two pairs of those were the same band twice: "Latest
 * releases" and "Coming soon" were both 92dp poster rails with an inverted date
 * predicate, rendered back to back; "From people you follow" and "Latest
 * reviews" were the same component from the same query, separated by ~2,900dp
 * of other content, and `newest` is *defined* as the residue after `followed`
 * is removed. Both pairs are now single bands.
 *
 * **"Fresh collections" was cut rather than merged.** It had no sibling to
 * merge with and it was the most expensive band on the page — a plain
 * horizontal `ScrollView`, so six tiles × four mosaic covers meant 24 images
 * fetched unconditionally with no windowing, most of them never seen.
 * Collections are still reachable from Search and from any profile. If it comes
 * back it should come back as a `FlatList`.
 *
 * **The month's chart is deliberately not here.** It led the page for a while
 * and it was the least personal thing on it — a chart is the same for everyone,
 * which makes it the wrong thing to open a signed-in home screen with. It still
 * leads the Search tab, where browsing is the point, and `/top-games` is still
 * a route.
 *
 * Every band fails independently and says so where it happens — one dead RSS
 * feed removes one band's contents and leaves the rest of the page working,
 * which is why nothing here gates on a shared loading state.
