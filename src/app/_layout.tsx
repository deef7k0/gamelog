        app was relying on whatever `expo-router` happens to mount internally.
        That held in Expo Go and did not survive a real build: SDK 57 targets
        Android 15, where **edge-to-edge is mandatory**, so the window draws
        under both system bars and the only thing keeping content out from under
        them is the inset the provider reports. With no provider of our own, the
        top bar sat under the status bar and the tab bar sat under the
        navigation bar — which is exactly the shape of the bug.

        It costs nothing in Expo Go (a second provider would be redundant, not
        wrong) and it is the documented requirement of the library. Insets are
        not something to inherit by luck.

            No native header, anywhere.

            Every screen draws its own `<FrostedTopBar>` through `<Screen topBar>`
            instead. Three things the native header could not do, and all three
            are the point:

              - **Blur.** `headerBackground` renders inside the native bar, which
                is not a sibling of the page content and so cannot be given the
                Android `BlurTargetView` to sample. The frosted look was not
                available from there at all.
              - **Hide on scroll.** The native stack header is a platform view;
                Reanimated cannot translate it, and there is no `header` option
                on `@react-navigation/native-stack` to replace it with one that
                can.
              - **The back chevron.** `headerBackButtonDisplayMode: 'minimal'`
                got close on iOS and left Android on its own arrow.

            The trade is that a screen now states its own title rather than
            inheriting one from here. That is a small loss of central bookkeeping
            and a real gain in honesty: a dynamic title used to be declared in
            two places and only one of them was right.
