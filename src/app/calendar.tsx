 * Opened from the Calendar button at the top of Search.
 *
 * ## One list, read on either side of today
 *
 * Behind today a month shows its **top releases**; ahead of today it shows the
 * **most anticipated** games still to come. They are one ranking: IGDB's
 * follows-before-release plus its ratings-after (`calendarWeight`), so a month
 * moves from "awaited" to "played" without anything on this screen changing
 * how it sorts. The heading under the month is the only thing that says which
 * side of today you are on.
 *
 * ## The month, then the games
 *
 * The grid is the days of the month and nothing else: five rows of seven, each
 * square under its number, the day's biggest game as its cover and a count
 * where there are more (`monthRows`). No weekdays — it had a row of them and
 * started each month on the day its 1st fell on, which cost a sixth row and a
 * header for a fact nobody reads a release calendar for; the owner had both
 * taken out, and the squares grew into the room.
 *
 * Under the grid are the month's games, biggest first, **as covers three
 * across** — the app's grid, titled and dated, because a month is browsed.
 * **Touching a day turns that into a list**: the day's games as rows, each with
 * the number that put it there. A day holds one to five games and is read; a
 * month holds dozens and is looked through.
 *
 * ## What is not on a square
 *
 * A game IGDB knows only as "November 2026" is in November's list with no day,
 * and one known only as "2026" is in the year's own list at the foot. IGDB
 * stores both as a real timestamp — the last day of the month, 31 December —
 * and a calendar that believed it would release forty games on New Year's Eve
 * (`precisionOf`).
 *
 * One request pair per year, kept for hours; every month and every day is read
 * out of it in memory.
