        Group 1 — identity, as one row set into the foot of the art: the
        billing from the page's margin, the cover against the far one.

        The arrangement, and every size and interval in it, is the owner's
        reference — a film's page in Letterboxd — measured off a screenshot and
        written down in `constants/game-masthead`. Three things about it are
        the owner's rulings, and each replaced one:

        **It is in the fade.** "Not below it, not above it, right into it": the
        row rises into the hero until the top of the cover is on the last tenth
        of the art, and the art has gone by the title a few lines down. It sat
        twelve under the hero's edge before this, on the rule that nothing is
        laid on the art — and before that the cover rose half its height into
        the picture, "a boxed copy propped against a poster". What is under the
        row now is the art's last trace, which is neither.

        **The cover is on the right.** The billing starts at the margin and is
        set left, as it always was; the cover changed sides, so the name is the
        first thing on the row and the box closes it.

        **It is smaller.** The cover is 28% of the display (it was a third) and
        the type came down with it — see the billing.

        Top-aligned, the billing twelve under the top of the cover: that puts
        the name's capitals eighteen under it, where the reference's title is,
        and keeps them there whatever the billing's length — so the name is in
        the last of the fade on every game. Centred against the cover, a game
        with one line under its name dropped out of the fade altogether; any
        slack falls under the billing instead, beside the foot of the cover.
      */}

          {/*
          The billing: the name, then what the game is in three quiet lines.

          Sizes are the reference's, matched by capital height (to Inter, since
          replaced by Poppins app-wide): 22 for
          the name (its own step, `styles.billingTitle` — `Type` has nothing
          between 20 and 23) and `body` for the rest. It was 28 / 18 / 15, a size
          above the interface, on the argument that the cover beside it does not
          ride the type scale; the owner had "everything in the top sized down"
          and the cover with it, so the two still agree.

          Inks are the reference's too, by lightness: its title is pure white
          and everything under it a mid blue-grey at L* 76–81, on a page at L*
          10. A game's page is M3's tone 10 and `accent.quietInk` its tone 82 —
          the same ladder, carrying this game's trace instead of Letterboxd's.

          The lines are the three this row always had, at the owner's choice: no
          "developed by" label and no capitals. Nothing was bold but the name
          until the developers' names took the Developers card's place here —
          see the lines themselves.

          Four lines for the name, not three: a long title — "The Legend of
          Zelda: Breath of the Wild" — runs to three at this measure, and a
          game's name is the one thing on its own page that must not end in an
