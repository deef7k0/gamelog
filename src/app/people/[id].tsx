 * The people behind a profile's counts.

 * Friends in the tappable-count idiom every social app uses — bold number, muted
 * label, side by side — since it was written, and none of them led anywhere,
 * because there was no route to lead to. The layout made a promise the app could
 * not keep, and it stranded the product's own social pillar: you could
 * accumulate followers and never once see who they were.
 *
 * **One screen, three lists, not three screens.** Followers, Following and
 * Friends are the same shape — a list of people — and the question a visitor has
 * is usually comparative ("do we know the same people?"). Splitting them across
 * routes would make that a back-and-forth; a tab strip makes it a tap. It is
 * also why the count that was tapped preselects its own tab rather than always
 * opening on the first.
