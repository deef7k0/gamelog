 * fetching them. They come out of the grid and into their own rail.
 *
 * `best` and `redone` are *views* into the catalogue, not removals from it. A
 * studio's best game is still one of its games and still belongs in a complete
 * list; a remake is a release in its own right with its own page. Rails that
 * duplicate what the grid holds are how every browsing surface works — the rail
 * is an argument about where to start, the grid is the record.
 *
 * ## Why `best` is originals only
 *
 * A remaster inherits its parent's reception and frequently scores a point or two
 * higher for it. Left in, "Best rated" fills up with the same games'
 * remasters, and the rail stops answering "what should I play" and starts
 * answering "which re-release reviewed best".

/**
 * A studio's catalogue.
 *
 * ## What this stopped being
 *
 * A count and a hundred-cover grid, which is the right page for a reader who
 * already knows the studio and is checking what they shipped last year, and the
 * wrong one for everybody else: a publisher's page opened from a game they liked
 * answered "here is everything, in release order" when the question was "what
 * else of theirs is good". Four hundred covers deep, release order is close to
 * random.
 *
 * So the grid stays — it is the record, and the sort row is what makes it usable
 * — and bands go above it, each answering a question release order cannot:
 * what is newest, what is best rated, what people played most, what is coming,
 * each of its big franchises (the owner's, 2026-10-22), what it has gone back
 * and redone, and which of its games exist in more than one box. Every one
 * comes out of the list already fetched; see `shelves`.
 *
 * ## The page takes the banner's colour; the controls do not
 *
 * The header is SimpMusic's artist page, read from `ArtistScreen.kt`: the
 * artwork square and full width, melting into a page that is the banner
 * game's Material 3 page — the owner's, 2026-10-22; it was near black from
 * 2026-10-17, so a trailer's letterbox bars met it without an edge — and the
 * studio's name set over the bottom: as its logo, when Wikimedia Commons has a
 * public-domain one (`useStudioLogo`, `<StudioIdentity>`), else as type in the
 * same palette's colour.
 *
 * The colour is the page's and nothing else's. There is still no
 * `<AccentProvider>`: this page shows a hundred games, and a sort pill or a link
 * in one title's hue would claim that game speaks for the catalogue. So the
 * chrome stays the app's — neutral controls, the house blue on what is selected
 * — and only the ground under it changes.
 *
 * ## What arrives, and when
 *
 * The name is on screen from the route. Everything else is two IGDB requests
 * away — the company, then its games (`useStudioCatalogue`) — and then the
 * banner and its colour, read from a 3 KB thumbnail of the banner art while the
 * art itself downloads, so the colour lands first and the art on it. The
 * banner downloads ahead of every cover (`priority`), and the grid exists only
 * a screen either side of the scroll, so two hundred covers do not race it.
 *
 * A studio opened before skips the wait for the two that matter most: its
 * banner is remembered (`useStudioBanner`), so the art comes from the disk
 * cache and the colour from the colour store before IGDB has answered. The
 * logo, when there is one, is a month-long answer on the device and costs no
 * IGDB request of its own (`useStudioLogo`).
 *
 * IGDB-only. Company ids come from `getGameExtras` and nothing else in the app
 * has an equivalent, so studio names are only tappable on IGDB titles.
