 * ## What this screen costs
 *
 * One IGDB request per *batch of fifty*, not per deal. Swiping walks a cursor
 * through a batch already in memory; a new request happens only when the batch
 * runs out or the mode changes. The soundtrack is the only other external call:
 * one question to the `soundcloud` function per game, which remembers which
 * upload matched (as an id — migration 0036) and searches SoundCloud only for a
 * game nobody has dealt before. A song's stream is asked for when its play key
 * is pressed, never when the card lands.
 *
 * ## Why it does not scroll
 *
 * Because the action cannot afford to be below a fold. The reroll button used to
 * begin roughly 110dp past the bottom of a 390×844 display and the scroll offset
 * never reset, so every deal after the first happened off-screen: you scrolled
 * down, pressed, and the new game rendered above the viewport. The reveal is a
 * single image now, sized to the display it has, and the swipe replaces the trip.
 *
 * ## Why this screen may take a game's colour
 *
 * It shows exactly one game at a time, which is the condition CLAUDE.md sets for
 * `<AccentProvider>`. The rule against it exists because twenty games in a list
 * is twenty hues; one game filling the screen is the case the accent was built
 * for, and it is most of what separates this from a dice roll with a title on it.

          screen — and entirely below the fold on a 375×667 one. The thing
          clipping at the fold was a *wrapping chip row*, which is the least

          wrapped", never as "there is a button underneath".

          Raising the chips and pills to the tap floor added roughly 120dp above
          it, so leaving it in the scroll would have taken the last 34dp too.
          Pinning is not a workaround for that — it is what the control wanted
          anyway. A commit action on a form whose whole body is optional
          refinement should not be reachable only by exhausting the refinement,
          and this screen's own docblock already records the same bug being found
          and fixed on the dealt screen.

          A flex sibling rather than an absolute overlay, so it *takes* its space
          instead of covering the last row of chips, and nothing needs a blur or
          a scrim to stay legible over moving content.

          they started 28dp in from the bezel, they stopped where the cover

          in two narrow columns in the upper middle of the display and nowhere
          else. You had to find it.

          A pan on the container has no geometry to get wrong. It starts at the

          cards, anywhere. It does not eat taps either: both gestures wait for
          `ACTIVATE_AT` of horizontal travel before activating, so a press that
          does not move still reaches the button under it, and one that does move
          cancels that press the way any scroll view would.

          `Race`, not `Simultaneous`: the two are one-sided and opposite, so at
          most one can ever claim a drag — and racing them makes that explicit

              The swipe lights, and they are the **last** thing in the stage.

              They belong to the *display*, not to the artwork: the gesture starts
              at the bezel, so the light does too, and each one reaches exactly
              half the screen — see `<SwipeEdge>` for why that boundary is the
              radius rather than a container edge.

              They were mounted first, under the body, on the argument that the
              cover and the type should paint over them. That held while the cover
              was a 165dp poster with clear margin either side. It does not hold
              now: the square runs to 84% of the width, so the word telling you
              what releasing will do sat *behind the artwork* — the one moment the
              light exists for was the one moment you could not read it. Painting
              last fixes it and costs nothing, because the layer is
              `pointerEvents="none"` and fully transparent at rest.
