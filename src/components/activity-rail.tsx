 * What people have been playing, as a row of covers with a face under each —
 * Home's "New from friends".

 *   ▯▯▯▯   ▯▯▯▯   ▯▯▯▯
 *   ▯▯▯▯   ▯▯▯▯   ▯▯▯▯
 *   ◍ Ada  ◍ Kaan ◍ Lan
 *     84 ≡   91     77 ≡
 * ```
 *
 * The owner's reference (2026-10-09): the row of that name on Letterboxd's
 * home. Under each poster a small face, the person's name, and what they gave
 * it — here the 0–100 score in the score ramp's colour — with a mark when
 * there are words behind the number.
 *
 * It took the place of Home's stack of review cards, at the owner's direction.
 * A card is somebody's writing; this is the news that they played something,
 * so a score with no review belongs in it and a review's text does not.
 *
 * ## One target
 *
 * A cover and its foot are one button. It opens the review when one was
 * written, and otherwise that person's record of the game — both are pages
 * about this person and this game, and both carry the way to the person. Two
 * targets would have put a 22dp face under a thumb.
 *
 * ## No Must Play badge
 *
 * These are covers in a row about people, not the catalogue, so they are not
 * given the label (CLAUDE.md § Labels: reviews and the surfaces made of them
 * go without).
