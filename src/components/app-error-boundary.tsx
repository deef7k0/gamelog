/**
 * What the app shows when a screen throws while rendering.
 *
 * Exported from the root layout as `ErrorBoundary`, which Expo Router wraps
 * the whole app in. There was none: a render error closed a release build.
 *
 * ## Why it empties the query cache
 *
 * Since queries are kept on the device between launches (`lib/query-persist`),
 * a screen can be handed data an older build wrote. Everything written is
 * checked to be plain JSON and stamped with a version, and a launch that dies
 * early drops the lot — but a screen deep in the app that cannot read an old
 * row would otherwise throw every time it was opened, for a week, because the
 * refetch that would replace the row never gets to finish. So a render error
 * anywhere forgets what was saved, in memory and on disk. If the cache was the
 * cause, "Try again" works; if it was not, nothing was lost but a warm start.
 *
 * ## Why it is built from so little
 *
 * It replaces the root layout, so nothing the layout provides exists here: no
 * safe-area provider, no query provider, no navigator. Hence a plain `<View>`
 * with its own padding rather than `<Screen>`, which reads the insets.
