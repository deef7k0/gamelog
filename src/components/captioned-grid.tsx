 * three by three, each answering the same prompt in a different way. Two columns
 * would make it a feed and four would put the captions under 80dp of artwork,
 * where a phrase like "Have cooked longer" cannot be read. Three is the widest
 * grid where the caption is still a *heading* rather than a footnote.

/**
 * A collection where every game carries a line of the owner's own text.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * "Games that should… get a remake / be a TV show / have been GOTY". The list's
 * title asks a question and each tile answers it, which is a different object
 * from every other kind here: a plain collection is a set, a ranked list is an
 * order, a tier list is a grading, an award show is a ballot. This one is a
 * *board* — the caption is the content and the game is the illustration.
 *
 * ## Why the caption is inside the tile
 *
 * Because the pairing is the whole point. A row of covers with a separate row of
 * labels under it reads as a grid with a legend, and the reader has to do the
 * matching; a bordered container holding one cover and one phrase reads as one
 * statement. That container is also what lets the board survive being
 * screenshotted, which is what this format is actually for.
 *
 * ## Captions are the owner's, and only the owner's
 *
 * Tapping a tile opens the game, exactly as it does everywhere else. The owner
 * gets a second affordance — a pencil on the caption — rather than having the
 * tile's primary tap stolen for editing, because a board is read far more often
 * than it is written.

   * The gutters belong to the grid, not to the page, so the tile is the
   * remaining space divided evenly — floored, because a fractional width leaves
   * a sub-pixel seam on the right-hand column of every row.
   *
   * **The extra 1dp is not superstition.** When the division comes out exact —
   * 360dp phone, 336 available, three 108s and two 6s summing to precisely 336 —
   * the row has *zero* slack, and any rounding in the layout pass tips the last
   * tile onto a second line. That failure is silent and total: you get two
   * columns instead of three and nothing reports why. One point of headroom is
   * invisible and makes the wrap impossible.
