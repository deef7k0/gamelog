 *      Collection type · x games
 *
 * (picture) username        (share) (like)
 * About
 * ```
 *
 * Half a screen of artwork — one game's, the one that represents the
 * collection — melting into the page through a smoothstep scrim over its bottom
 * 70%, with the name and what it is set *over* the bottom of it, centred. That much is SimpMusic's
 * album header, read from `AlbumScreen.kt`. Under it, on the page's solid
 * colour, one row: who made it on the left, share and like on the right. Then
 * the description. The sort tools and the games are the screen's, below.
 *
 * ## What the owner changed, and it is three things
 *
 * **The byline came off the art.** It was the middle line of the title stack —
 * name, owner, kind — printed over the cover. It is under the art now, on solid
 * ground, at the left of a row of its own: a person is somebody to go and see,
 * and that is a control, not a caption.
 *
 * **Like is no longer the page's one big button.** The row was circle, white
 * pill, circle — share, a filled "Like" pill in the reference's Play slot, and
 * an overflow. The pill is gone: share and like are the reference's two quiet
 * 48dp circles at the right of the byline's row, and the like carries its count
 * beside its heart once it has one.
 *
 * **The owner's menu left the row for the top of the screen.** Rename, add
 * games, change the cover, delete: SimpMusic's album keeps "more" in a glass
 * control at the top right, opposite the back button, and that is where it is —
 * the screen's top bar, as a `<TopBarDisc>`. So this component no longer knows
 * whether the viewer owns the collection: the menu is `<CollectionOwnerMenu>`,
 * exported below, and the screen that owns the top bar opens it. The row here
 * measures the same for everybody.
 *
 * ## One left edge
 *
 * The byline, the description, the sort tools and the games all start on the
 * page's margin. The body used to be the reference's own column, 32 in, which
 * suited a row centred on the art's axis; a row with a name at one end and
 * buttons at the other belongs to the edges the list under it keeps.
 *
 * ## One game, always
 *
 * The owner's ruling: "inside the collection screen only have one game
 * displayed". The art is the collection's cover (`collectionCover`) — the game
 * its owner chose, or its first — for every kind of collection, an award show
 * included. It used to be that *or* a 2×2 mosaic of the first four, a setting on
 * each collection (`lists.cover_style`, 0033) with a trophy laid over the mosaic
 * of an award show. The mosaic was removed from the app with the setting; what
 * says "Award show" is the line under the title.
 *
 * ## The page takes that cover's colour
 *
 * The screen fills with the cover's immersive colour
 * (`useImmersiveBackground`) and the scrim melts into it — every collection
 * with a game in it now, where it was only those showing one cover. The colour
 * is the background's alone — the actions keep a neutral wash.
 *
 * ## The fade is a ramp, not a blur
 *
 * A blurred copy of the artwork revealed through a mask is the game page's
 * treatment and belongs there. A plain ramp to the page colour is what the
 * reference uses and it is the honest one: the artwork does not dissolve, the
 * page takes over underneath it.
