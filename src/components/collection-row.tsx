/**
 * One game as a row: cover, title, and who made it and when.
 *
 * The alternative to the grid, and it exists because the two answer different
 * questions. A wall of covers is for *recognising* — you are looking for the box
 * you remember, and the artwork is the whole content. A list is for *reading* —
 * ninety games deep, a title and a studio scan far faster than ninety pieces of
 * box art, and the year is a fact the grid cannot show at all without a caption
 * under every tile.
 *
 * Two lines, not three. Title, then studio and year joined on one muted line —
 * they are one fact about provenance, and giving each its own line makes a row
 * of ninety twice as tall for no gain.
 *
 * ## Choosing rows to remove
 *
 * A long press on the owner's own row starts a selection (`onStartSelecting`),
 * and from then on the row is a checkbox rather than a link: it takes the app's
 * one selected state (`useSelectable`) and a `<Checkbox>` where the eye already
 * is. The screen holds the set and draws the button that acts on it.
 *
 * ## Handlers take the game's id
 *
 * So the screen can hand every row the same three functions. They used to be
 * closures made per row — and the cross a JSX element made per row — which
 * meant no two renders gave a row the same props, the `memo` below never held,
 * and ticking one game re-drew all ninety.
