/**
 * One physical copy, turning on its stage: its case, and the disc inside it.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Left alone, the copy **drifts round** — about a lap every twenty-four
 * seconds, slowing on the cover and on the back. A touch stops it.
 *
 *  - **Drag sideways** and it turns with the finger, to any angle; let go and
 *    it carries on with the flick and comes to rest square on a face.
 *  - **Tap the cover** and the case opens: the cover swings about its spine and
 *    the disc is there in its tray. Tap anywhere but the disc to shut it.
 *  - **Tap the disc, or drag it**, and it comes up off its hub; the case shuts
 *    and leaves, and the disc stands alone where the case stood, and turns as
 *    the case did — label one way, mirror the other. Flick it left to put it
 *    back.
 *  - **Tilt the phone** and the lamp moves: its reflection slides across the
 *    plastic, the pool on the floor and the shadow shift, and the object leans
 *    a few degrees to follow.
 *
 * A vertical drag is none of these; it scrolls the page.
 *
 * It was two gestures on a flat case — a tap turned it over, a drag to the
 * right drew the disc out from behind it. The owner asked for a screen to stay
 * on and handle the thing, and chose these.
 *
 * ## What is true of the copy stays true
 *
 * A **sealed** copy does not open: it answers a tap with a short shake. A copy
 * on a **cartridge or a card** has nothing drawn to take out yet, so it turns
 * and catches the light and no more — and a tap turns it over, as a tap always
 * did. What is **inside** an open case is what its owner recorded
 * (`caseContents`). And the copy's edition is still printed on the back of the
 * case and nowhere else.
 *
 * ## The case is this screen's own
 *
 * The protected `<GameCase>` is a face with a shadow. This is a box: six
 * surfaces in one space, turned by hand. The owner lifted the case's protection
 * for this screen alone so that it could be; nothing here touches `<GameCase>`,
 * `<GameCaseDisplay>`, `<GameCaseFlip>` or `<GameCaseBack>`, and the cover is
 * drawn from the same templates by the same arithmetic (`<CopyCaseFront>`).
 *
 * Each surface is a `<StageFace>`, placed every frame by `lib/stage-geometry`,
 * which is where to read why a box cannot simply be six rotated views.
 *
 * ## Everything that moves is one of a few numbers, on the UI thread
 *
 * `turn` and `discTurn` are how far round the case and the disc are; `open` is
 * the cover's swing and `out` the disc's exchange with its case, each 0–1;
 * `tiltX` / `tiltY` the phone. Every face's place, the light on it and the
 * shadow under it are derived from those in worklets. React hears about two
 * things only: which object is on the stage (`mode`), and which side of it is
 * showing (`onSideChange`) — neither more than a few times a minute.
 *
 * ## A re-render nudges the stage
 *
 * Reanimated can lose the last value of an animated style when the JS thread
 * stalls while it settles, and the next render then shows the view's first
 * frame (CLAUDE.md § Gotchas). The usual answer is to restate the resting pose
 * as a plain style, which works for a pose React can name. A case left turned
 * a quarter of the way round has no such name, so instead every render bumps
 * `pulse`, which every face's place depends on: they are all re-solved and
 * re-applied the frame after, whatever was lost. The arrival, whose end React
 * does know, is restated the usual way.
