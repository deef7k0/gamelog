 * The owner's redesign (2026-10-21) of the zoom they asked for the day before:
 * "the artwork must be full-size zoomed in to the edges of the screen… The
 * space left below should be filled with the same effect that SimpMusic uses
 * for their Apple Music Now Playing screen style, with the blur from the
 * image, fading/blending into the artwork above. In that space, you should
 * add a button for 'static' or 'animated'. Only fetch animated when the user
 * taps on the animated button, and show if it has one. The buttons should be
 * text alone, in bold. Not inside a pill or a container. Static above and
 * Animated below."
 *
 * - **The cover runs edge to edge from the top of the display**, under the
 *   status bar, at 2:3. A display too short to leave `ROOM_BELOW` under it
 *   trims the cover's height, never its width.
 * - **Under it is SimpMusic's Apple Music page** (`<ArtworkMeshPage>`, a port
 *   of `AppleMusicMeshBackdrop.kt`): the cover's colours as a blurred mesh
 *   hung from its foot, the first row of which is the foot itself. The page
 *   is drawn again over the cover's last eighth inside a mask
 *   (`DISSOLVE_SHARE`), so the cover dissolves into it — the reference's own
 *   method for a clip it cannot mask, and the only one that works over
 *   Android's video surface. The mesh is read from the still cover; with the
 *   animation on, the page keeps the box art's colours.
 * - **Static and Animated** are bold words on that page, one over the other,
 *   no pill. Nothing is looked up until Animated is pressed
 *   (`useAnimatedCover`, `enabled` from then, `explicit` so the Animated
 *   artwork setting does not stand in the way of somebody asking). It then
 *   crossfades in, or the line under it says the game has none — which a
 *   known answer says before anybody presses. Reduce Motion: the word is
 *   there, unavailable, and says why.
 * - **A copy of the cover, not the cover**: drawn in a modal, laid out at its
 *   full size and transformed down onto the masthead cover's measured place,
 *   then transitioned to rest, its corner going from the masthead's to none.
 *   CSS transitions on React props (Reanimated 4), so the pose cannot be lost
 *   to a stalled frame (CLAUDE.md, the lost end value).
 * - **The cover is sharp at full size**: the 1080p cover (`sharpCoverUrl`),
 *   the page's own `t_cover_big` drawn while it loads.
 * - The close key, the system's back and a tap anywhere but the two words
 *   reverse the zoom.
