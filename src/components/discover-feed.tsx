/**
 * Discover, before anything is typed: the answer to "what should I play".
 *
 * The owner's reference for it (2026-10-09) is Letterboxd's home, and this is
 * that page in the app's materials:
 *
 * ```text
 *   ░░░░ the slider: two new, one awaited, the calendar ░░░░
 *   Popular this month                        ›
 *   ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯
 *   Similar to Hades
 *   ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯
 *   Beloved by the community           Month ▾
 *   ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯
 *   Highly rated
 *   ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯▯ ▯▯
 *   Top 1000                  ( GameLog )( Critics )
 *    1 ▯ …                                       98
 *   ‹ 1 2 3 … 50 ›
 *   Browse by genre
 * ```
 *
 * ## The Top 1000
 *
 * The owner's request (2026-10-20): a ranking of the best-reviewed games on
 * GameLog, a toggle to rank them by the critics instead, twenty to a page
 * (`<TopChart>`). After the rows of covers, before the genres: it is the one
 * band here that is a list to read down, and turning its page brings its
 * heading back to the top of the screen (`chartY`).
 *
 * ## The slider leads
 *
 * `<SpotlightSlider>` took the place of the Calendar button — the calendar is
 * its last slide. A light lay under it for three builds; the owner had it
 * removed ("Remove the glow from the search screen").
 *
 * ## No collections here
 *
 * A band of the most-liked collections closed this page. The owner had it
 * taken out of the Games tab: collections have a tab of their own two pills
 * along, which shows the same list before anything is typed.
 *
 * ## Every row of games stands on the page
 *
 * A one-line heading (`<HomeSection>`), a chevron where there is somewhere to
 * go, and under it small covers with nothing printed under them
 * (`<GameCoverRail>`). A row prints a line under its covers only for what the
 * box cannot say — a chart's rank, what the people here scored it.
 *
 * **Not in cards.** The first build drew each row inside a rounded panel, as
 * the reference does; the owner saw it on a phone and had the cards removed.
 *
 * ## "Beloved by the community" is where the Reviews band was
 *
 * The most-liked writing was a band of three review cards here; it is still
 * what the Reviews tab shows before anything is typed. In its place: the games
 * GameLog's own scores rank highest (`getBelovedGames`, migration 0037), with
 * the period — week, month, year — as a small dropdown at the far end of the
 * heading. A database that has not run 0037 has no such row; a period nobody
 * scored anything in says so, and keeps the control that leads back out of it.
 *
 * ## One "Similar to…" rail, not a "For you"
 *
 * Home already has "Games for you", built from every log. This is the other
 * thing: one seed — the game reviewed last (`recommendationSeed`) — named in
 * the heading, so the row says why it is what it is. Two rows with one name
 * and different games would look broken.
 *
 * A `ScrollView`: nothing here is a long vertical list — the rails are
 * horizontal and windowed.
