 * picked by holding the case; with the choice made further down the page, a
 * price at the top would change out of sight, so it moved to sit under the
 * control that changes it. It carries no platform glyph of its own: the button
 * directly above it already does. It no longer swaps a store link either:
 * buying is Overview's "Where to buy", which lists every storefront rather than
 * sending the reader to one.
 *
 * Uses IsThereAnyDeal, which tracks PC shops only: the cheapest of them for
 * the PC, the Microsoft Store for an Xbox, and nothing for a platform no ITAD
 * shop sells for — see `PLATFORM_STORE_IDS`. Shares its requests with Where to
 * buy (`useGamePrices`).

                An alpha badge over the old ambient gradient had no fixed
                background — its contrast was whatever the gradient happened to
                be under it, which measured 3.77:1 (discount) and 3.95:1
                (all-time low) at the top of the page. A solid `surface` behind
                them is a known quantity and puts both at ~10:1.
                
                `label`, not `caption` + `fontWeight: '700'`. That weight was a
                no-op: React Native will not synthesise bold from a custom font
                on Android, so the one emphatic element in this row rendered
                regular on half the devices that shipped it. `Type.label` is a
                separately loaded Medium family and carries its weight for real. */}

        This used to carry an "Open on Steam" row under the price. It was the
        masthead — the block that answers *what is this game* — quietly turning
        into a storefront, and it duplicated a control that already exists and
        does the job better: Overview's "Where to buy" lists every storefront
        ITAD tracks with its own price beside it, so the reader picks a shop
        rather than being sent to whichever one happened to be cheapest.

        The price stays, because a price is a fact about the game. Buying is an
        action, and actions on this page live under the tabs.
