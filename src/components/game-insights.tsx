 * The owner's direction (2026-10-09): the ratings graph "used inside the
 * reviews sheet", on the Overview — in a card titled as the reference's is, a
 * film's page in Letterboxd. The graph is `<ScoreSummary>`, the sheet's own,
 * so the two are one thing; the card is a door to that sheet, where the same
 * summary heads every review.
 *
 * **The count is under the verdict**, at the owner's direction (2026-10-16):
 * "display the rating label like 'Very Positive' and below that the amount of
 * reviews". It was at the far end of the title — "128 ratings" — with the
 * summary told not to say it twice; it moved, so the card reads as Steam's
 * does and as the sheet's head already did, and the title stands alone.
 *
 * **The app's own numbers, never IGDB's.** This answers what an outside score
 * cannot: what the people here thought.
 *
 * Renders nothing when nobody has rated the game — an empty graph under a real
 * heading claims a distribution exists and that it is flat — and nothing while
 * it loads: the page's masthead asks for the same numbers under the same key,
 * so they have nearly always arrived with the page.

 *
 * A strip of three in a titled card, as the Ratings card above it is: the
 * strip is the masthead's, a figure over a quiet line with rules between, so
 * the page has one way of setting a number. **A zero is printed** — it is a
 * number the app knows, as the masthead's "0 Collections" is — so the card is
 * there for every game, once its answer is in. Its shape is held while it
 * loads so nothing under it moves; a failed request says so in the card and
 * offers a retry — it vanished, so a game whose counts would not load looked
 * like one that had no card (critique, 2026-10-21).
 *
 * Invalidated by anything that writes a status or the wishlist
 * (`['game-audience', gameId]`): the log form, the progress sheet, the
