 * metadata string — a reader scanning twenty rows for a platform or a year is
 * scanning a *column*, and "2024 · FromSoftware · PS5, PC" makes them read a
 * sentence to find one word.
 *
 * ## There is no price here, and that was a decision
 *
 * It was built and taken out. Pricing one game is up to three chained requests
 * — IGDB for its store links, ITAD to resolve an id, ITAD again for the deals —
 * and only the last of those can be batched across a list. A twenty-row list is
 * twenty id lookups against a rate-limited Edge Function shared with search,
 * every time someone opens Discover. `getStorePricesBatch` survives in
 * `lib/games/itad.ts` because the game page still wants it, and because it is
 * the piece that would make this affordable if the id lookups ever became
 * batchable or precomputed. Until then the row is free to render.
 *
 * ## What is allowed to be coloured
 *
 * Two things, and they are both data. The score, via the app's one score ramp.
 * And the status capsule — "Coming soon", "In your library" — which gets the
 * row's single solid fill. Everything else, platform chips included, is grey:
 * this row already sits under box art, which is the loudest thing on any screen
 * in this app, and a run of vendor-coloured capsules under it reads as confetti
 * rather than as information.
 *
 * ## Platforms collapse to families
 *
 * A game on PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series is two chips, not four — one
 * PlayStation mark and one Xbox mark. See `constants/platform-family.ts`; the
 * generational distinction is real and belongs on the game's own page, where
 * the reader is choosing which version they own.
