/**
 * Every collection that holds one game.
 *
 * ## Why it is a sheet and not a route
 *
 * Same argument as the reviews sheet beside it: this is a lateral glance from the
 * game page, not a place you navigate to, and the page underneath stays mounted
 * so dismissing it is a reveal rather than a back-navigation that re-fetches a
 * masthead. It is raised by the strip's "COLLECTIONS" cell.
 *
 * ## Full height, not the picker's half
 *
 * The platform picker caps itself at half the display because its entire result
 * is the artwork behind it changing, so covering the page would hide the thing
 * being chosen. Nothing here is behind the sheet to watch, and a collection row
 * is 96dp of mosaic plus a title, a byline and two lines of the owner's argument
 * — at half height that is two rows and a scroll bar, for a list whose whole
 * point is how many of them there are.
 *
 * ## The rows are `<ListTile>`, unmodified
 *
 * Deliberately the same object as the Collections tab and Discover, down to the
 * mosaic and the counts. A second, smaller collection row for this one surface
 * is how the profile ended up with its own copy of the tab bar, and the two
 * drifted the moment one was restyled.
 *
 * Engagement counts are omitted — see `ListTileProps.engagement`. They cannot
 * ride along with the summary (likes and comments are polymorphic and PostgREST
 * cannot aggregate across that), so having them here would mean a second batched
 * query per open, and the tile already shows the number that matters in this
 * context: how many games each shelf holds.
