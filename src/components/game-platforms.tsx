 * Which machines a game is on, and the box it comes in on each.
 *
 * A section of the Overview, on the page and not in a card: the object on the
 * left, and beside it the game's name continuing into a sentence about where it
 * is available, and the platform button. Choosing a platform re-draws the box —
 * a console case for PS5, PS4, Xbox and Switch, the plain cover for everything
 * else (DESIGN.md § 4.1.3).
 *
 * **No price here** (critique, 2026-10-21): it printed one platform's price
 * directly above Where to buy, which prices every store — the same figure
 * twice in a row. Where to buy is the one place a price is said.
 *
 * **This is where the case lives now.** The masthead always shows the plain
 * cover, and the turn-over came here with the case: tap or drag the box and it
 * shows your record on its back. A plain cover has no back, so it does not turn.
 *
 * **The slot is the height of the tallest shape this game can show**, with the
 * object at its top, level with the game's name beside it — the owner's
 * direction (2026-10-15): "every case must be aligned to the top of the
 * section, aligned with the game title". It stood at the slot's foot, as boxes
 * stand on a shelf, which left a short box (a SNES one, 0.62× its width) sunk
 * at the bottom with empty space over it. A PS5 case is 1.25× its width, a
 * plain cover 1.5×, a Switch 2 case 1.62×, so without the reservation switching
 * platform would move everything under the section.
