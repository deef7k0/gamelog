 * A band of a page: a heading on the page, and under it what the heading

 *
 * The heading is the owner's reference for a section (2026-10-09, Letterboxd's
 * home), in this app's type:
 *
 * - **`h2`**, one line — Apple Music's large section titles, at the owner's
 *   direction (2026-10-22: "make the texts for the sections title bigger").
 *   It was `h4` (16) for a while.
 * - **A chevron, not "See all".** A heading that leads somewhere is the link —
 *   the whole line — and ends in a quiet chevron.
 * - **A row of games has no subtitle**: the covers under it explain it. The
 *   line is for what is not a row of covers — a grid of ten genres does not
 *   explain itself.
 *
 * **On the page, not in a card.** For one build every row of games sat in a
 * rounded panel with its heading inside, as the reference's do; the owner saw
 * it on a phone and had the cards removed. This is what a row stands under.
 *
 * Separation between sections is set by the page (`Spacing.x32`, 32dp) rather
 * than here, so a section never decides its own distance from its neighbours.
