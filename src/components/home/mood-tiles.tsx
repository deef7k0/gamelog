/**
 * The foot of Home, whatever it is showing — SimpMusic's "Moods & Genres"
 * browse grid, at the owner's direction (2026-10-22): "Make mood and genre
 * buttons like the ones in simpmusic search screen, being blocks in a gradient
 * color with an image from a song."
 *
 * A line, then one block per section — the ten moods, then the ten genres —
 * each a 2:1 tile in its own hue as a gradient, with the name in white at the
 * top-left and **one game's cover tilted off the bottom-right corner**. Two to
 * a row, twelve apart, as the reference's `LazyVerticalGrid` lays them out on a
 * phone. `constants/mood-tile` holds every measurement, the gradient and the
 * ink, with the file each was read from, under `npm test`.
 *
 * A tile picks its mood or genre as the chips do — Home reloads in place with
 * that feed's shelves; a genre opened a page of its own until the owner had it
 * work as a mood does.
 *
 * It replaced the reference's *other* moods grid, `MoodMomentAndGenre` — small
 * striped cards, three rows deep, sliding sideways — which is what SimpMusic
 * puts at the foot of its own Home. The owner asked for the search screen's
 * blocks instead, and a 2:1 block in a three-row carousel would be a stamp.
 *
 * ## The covers arrive late, and only if you come this far
 *
 * The reference requests a category's artwork from inside the tile
 * (`LaunchedEffect(item.params) { loadMoodArtwork(…) }`), and says why: "a
 * category the user never scrolls to never costs a browse." That matters more
 * here than there — twenty tiles is twenty IGDB requests against credentials
 * every phone in the app shares — so the grid asks for nothing until it has
 * been scrolled to, and then its requests go through `mood-feed`'s own pacer,
 * behind whatever feed is on screen. They are kept on the device for a week.
 * A tile is finished without its cover and only ever gains one.
