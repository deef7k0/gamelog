 *   │ Finally a sequel that knows what the first │
 *   │ one was about, and the patience to say it… │
 *   │ ────────────────────────────────────────── │

 *
 * **The owner's reference** (2026-10-20, a music app's review card): the
 * writing first and alone, a rule under it, and the writer along the foot —
 * face, name, and the score where the reference sets its stars. Their
 * instruction for the score is the feed card's: GameLog's number and its
 * verdict word (`<ScoreLine>`), because a 0–100 scale has fifteen verdicts and
 * five stars cannot say which.
 *
 * It replaced the arrangement before it, which was a film page's in Letterboxd
 * — the face at the left of the words, the name and score across the top, the
 * likes on a line of their own. Everything that card carried is still here; it
 * is the order that changed, and the rule is what the reference puts between
 * the two halves.
 *
 * **At the far right, where the reference has a chip**, are the counts the
 * card has always carried: how many liked the review and how many replied,
 * each drawn only when there is one (a new review is a face, a name, a score
 * and its words, not "0 likes"). The heart lights when *you* have liked it.
 *
 * ## What was not carried over
 *
 * - **Stars**, as above.
 * - **The orange heart beside the rating.** In the reference's forebear it
 *   means the writer marked the film as liked. GameLog records no such thing
 *   about a game, and giving the mark a different meaning would be a quiet
 *   lie.
 *
 * ## The card itself
 *
 * The material is every card's (`useCardMaterial`, the review card's): the
 * corner the owner measured their references by, the hairline, fifteen in.
 * The fill is the game's own tone on its page and the app's neutral `surface`
 * in the sheet, so a review is the same object in a list and on a game's page.
 *
 * Not pressable itself — the row around it is, so there is one target and one
 * spoken label.
