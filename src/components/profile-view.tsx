/**
 * Four tabs, as four glyphs, under the profile — and Reviews leads.
 *
 * ## Where they are, and that it has been both ways
 *
 * Under the face, the counts, the favourites, the games and the pinned song:
 * the row that chooses what the rest of the page is. For a few days they were
 * at the top instead — four words in pills under the screen's bar, Profile
 * first, each tab the whole screen, after a Letterboxd-style reference — and
 * the wall was folded into that Profile tab. The owner used it and reversed
 * it (2026-10-09): "Go back to how the tabs were in the profile screen. The
 * tabs are below the game and starred song." So the profile is always on
 * screen above them again, the wall is a tab again, and there is no Profile
 * tab because the profile is not something to switch to. **Do not move them
 * back to the top.**
 *
 * **Reviews is the default** because PRODUCT.md's second pillar is serious
 * long-form criticism, and the profile's answer to "who is this person" should
 * be what they wrote rather than a chronological log of their taps.
 *
 * **About and Posts are still gone**, for the reasons they left: About restated
 * the header, and posts were removed from the app.
 *
 * ## They are glyphs, not words
 *
 * `label` is still required and still does real work — it is what the tab
 * announces to a screen reader. Only the *printed* word is absent
 * (`<TabBar iconOnly>`). Each glyph is one the app already uses for the same
 * idea: `albums` is what the game page's Collect action uses, `logo-steam` is
 * the platform's own, and a document and a speech bubble are the two most
 * conventional marks there are for "writing" and "what people said". Four
 * glyphs divide the row evenly at any width and cannot overflow.

 * ```
 *
 * One list: its header is all of that, its rows the chosen tab's, so pressing
 * a tab changes the rows and leaves the page where it is.
 *
 * ## The head is the owner's reference, centred (2026-10-17)
 *
 * "Pfp, username, follow count bio, etc, centered in the screen. Add a big
 * white filled rounded button for follow" — after a music app's profile. Only
 * the head changed: it was Instagram's, the face beside the name over the
 * counts, the bio under them and two half-width buttons. The widgets and the
 * tabs under it are as they were. Follow is the white pill, the friend
 * control a glyph beside it where the reference has its info mark, and share
 * the reference's own glyph (`profile-actions`).
 *
 * ## This is the old layout under the head, and it was gone for a week
 *
 * A Letterboxd-style profile replaced it for about a week (a 20pt margin, the
 * widgets as cards forty apart, a larger name, the counts centred, the bio set
 * apart). The owner used it and reversed it (2026-10-12): **"go back to the
 * old profile page layout, remove the widgets being inside cards… make the
 * margins 10"**. So: the compact head, twelve between its parts; the widgets
 * under hairlines (`<ProfileWidget>`); and the screen's margin is ten
 * (`PROFILE_MARGIN`) — the one figure that is neither the old layout's nor the
 * app's. Two things from the week stayed because the owner asked for them
 * separately: the games are four separate covers like the favourites, and the
 * handle is in the bar above on both screens, so the header's first line is
 * the name alone.
 *
 * ## Three counts, not four
 *
 * Logged, Followers, Following. **Friends was the fourth and the owner had it
 * taken off the top of the page** (2026-10-12) — "keep it as a tab in the
 * screen that opens up when the user taps on the following/follower count".
 * That screen (`people/[id]`) has its Friends tab still; the Friend button
 * under the bio is untouched.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * **There is no banner.** It was a `banner_url` free-text column with an
 * unvalidated URL behind it, and the majority of profiles set none. The column
 * and its type are left in place, the same way the `posts` tables were left
 * when posts were removed.
