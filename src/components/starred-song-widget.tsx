/**
 * The one song pinned to a profile.
 *
 * Modelled on the track pinned to an Instagram bio: a statement about taste
 * that the visitor can hear rather than only read. It renders nothing at all
 * when nobody has pinned one — an empty "no song" row on every profile would be
 * a permanent advert for a feature most people will not use.
 *
 * ## The profile stores an id and nothing else
 *
 * A star is a SoundCloud track's URN and the game it was starred from. The
 * title, the uploader and the artwork are asked of SoundCloud when the profile
 * is shown, because its terms forbid an app to keep them — which also means a
 * track its uploader takes down leaves the profile by itself. So there are two
 * queries here: whose star (Postgres), then what it is (SoundCloud).
 *
 * It draws nothing when the second has no answer to give: the track is gone,
 * SoundCloud is not connected, or the row is an Apple Music id from a database
 * that has not run 0036. A profile is not the place to explain any of those.
 * That is also why the space above it is its own (`styles.section`) and not the
 * profile's: a wrapper the profile kept for it would be a gap with nothing
 * under it on every profile that has no song.
 *
 * ## It plays through the app's one player
 *
 * And stops when the profile is left — another tab, a page opened over it —
 * if the song is still this widget's. Keep playing is the soundtrack screen's
 * switch and does not reach here: a pinned song ends with its profile.
