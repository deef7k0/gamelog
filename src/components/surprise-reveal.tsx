 * The owner's direction (2026-10-21): "Remove the way the artwork moves as a
 * card out of the screen, just make it a simple slide like SimpMusic when
 * sliding to the next song inside the now playing screen." So the art is a
 * pager — SimpMusic's `HorizontalPager` round its artwork — and nothing else
 * about it moves: the cards either side are already laid out a display's
 * width away, the strip follows the finger one for one, and a release springs
 * to the next page or back (`useDealGesture`). The card no longer lifts,
 * leans, turns, flies off or springs in, and the face-down deck behind it and
 * the light that caught its surface are gone with that.
 *
 * What stays is what is not the artwork moving: the room's light behind it
 * (`<SurpriseBloom>`) and the screen's edge lights, which say what letting go
 * will do. The words under the art change when the deck moves on, with a
 * short fade.
 *
 * Three cards are mounted — the one in front and one either side — each keyed
 * by its place in the deck, so the card that slides in is the one that was
 * already there, still and looked up. Only the card in front may load its
 * animation (`settled`), and it holds its frame while a finger is on the deck.
 *
 * ## Reduce Motion
 *
 * A swipe is an *input*, so the strip still follows the finger; the release
 * lands at once rather than springing, and the words crossfade. The visible
 * `Another game` key is not the gesture's fallback, it is a primary path —
 * and `accessibilityActions` puts both directions in the rotor besides.

 * What the double tap has to say, drawn over the cover it was performed on.
 *
 * ## Why it is on the artwork and not at the edge of the screen
 *
 * Because the artwork is what was pressed, and because nothing else moves. The
 * card is not replaced, not dimmed and not dismissed — so a toast in a corner
 * would be the only evidence a deliberate gesture on a specific object did
 * anything, sixty per cent of a screen away from the object. Covering the cover
 * is the acknowledgement: the thing you said "not this one" about is the thing
 * that goes behind glass.
 *
 * ## Why it is mounted even when it is not showing
 *
 * So it can fade out. An unmounted overlay can only appear and vanish; Reanimated
 * layout animations would give it an exit, but `exiting` on a view inside a
 * gesture-handled, spring-animated subtree is a lot of machinery to buy one
 * crossfade. Zero opacity plus `pointerEvents="none"` costs one static view and
 * leaves the double tap underneath reachable the whole time — which matters,
 * because hiding an already-hidden game is a legal thing to do and simply
 * restarts the ten seconds.
 *
 * The opacity beat runs under Reduce Motion: with every spring flattened, a
 * cut is not a transition.
