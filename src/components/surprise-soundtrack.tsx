 * The soundtrack, as one row.
 *
 * ## Why a row and not the card it replaced
 *
 * The reveal fits one viewport now, and the card wanted 230dp of it for artwork
 * the game's own case is already providing at four times the size. A row states
 * the same facts — what is playing and who uploaded it — in 64.
 *
 * ## What left, and where it went
 *
 * **The star is gone from this surface, deliberately.** It performed an upsert
 * that overwrites the profile's one pinned song, from a 32dp glyph, with no
 * confirmation and no undo, on a screen built for rapid mis-taps. That is the
 * most consequential action in the feature and it was also its smallest. Tapping
 * the row opens `/soundtrack/[id]`, which holds the full track list and the same
 * star — one tap away, on a screen where you are choosing a track deliberately
 * rather than thumbing past a card.
 *
 * ## The foot of the row is SoundCloud's
 *
 * The uploader's name is the row's second line, and SoundCloud's own mark
 * sits at the end of the progress line, linking to the track's page there. Together
 * they are the credit SoundCloud's API terms ask for wherever one of its
 * tracks is shown or played; the row is not allowed to be shorter than them.
 *
 * Purely presentational: the lookup, the pick and the player all live above it.
