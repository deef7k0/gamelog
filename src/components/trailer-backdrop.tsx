 * Artwork with its game's trailer under it — SimpMusic's artist header
 * (`ArtistScreen.kt`): the media layer is the video with the artwork on top,
 * and the artwork fades out over `ART_FADE_MS` once the video has drawn its
 * first frame. Until then — and for good, if the stream never starts — the
 * picture is what is seen; the video is never a black square. The game page's
 * hero and the studio page's banner.
 *
 * The artwork stays mounted under the faded layer: a page colour may be read
 * from it, and switching the trailer off brings it straight back.
 *
 * **The player exists only while this page is in front.** A covered page
 * unmounts it, which releases the decoder and the buffer; coming back mounts
 * a fresh one behind the picture, which fades again at its first frame. A
 * pause would keep the decoder, and a stack of game pages — each opened from
 * the last — would hold one each until playback failed on the next.
 *
 * **It plays only while it can be seen**: once the page has scrolled the
 * artwork away (read off the page's own scroll position on the UI thread,
 * crossing to React only when it changes) it pauses where it is. Under Reduce
 * Motion it is never mounted.
 *
 * **The caller covers the video's foot.** A video surface does not render
 * inside a mask on Android, so it cannot dissolve by its own alpha; both
 * pages that use this lay their hero's foot fade over it, into the key colour
 * (`<KeyColorHero>`), and the blur and the drain go over it too.
