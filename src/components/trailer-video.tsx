/**
 * A game's trailer, looping silently behind its artwork — SimpMusic's
 * `MediaPlayerView(cropToBounds = true)` behind its artist header. Drawn by
 * `<TrailerBackdrop>`, on the game page's hero and the studio page's banner.
 *
 * **Imported only through `React.lazy`** (`<TrailerBackdrop>`). expo-video
 * calls `requireNativeModule('ExpoVideo')` the moment it is imported, so a
 * static import would take the page down on any build made before the module
 * was added; loaded lazily, such a build draws the still artwork.
 *
 * What keeps it cheap, each from SimpMusic or from this app's own rules:
 *
 * - **No sound, by construction.** The url is the video's own playlist; the
 *   audio rendition is never fetched (`chooseRendition`). It is muted as
 *   well, and mixes with others so it can never pause the app's music or
 *   anybody else's.
 * - **It exists only while its page is in front.** `<TrailerBackdrop>`
 *   unmounts it when the page is covered, which releases the player, its
 *   decoder and its buffer — a stack of game pages, each opened from the
 *   last, holds one player, not one each. Phones have a handful of hardware
 *   decoders, and a pause keeps its decoder.
 * - **It plays only while it can be seen**: `playing` is false once the
 *   artwork scrolls away; it stops by itself when the app is left
 *   (`staysActiveInBackground` is false); under Reduce Motion it is never
 *   mounted.
 * - **A short buffer** (`FORWARD_BUFFER_S`), and no lock-screen controls, no
 *   picture in picture, no fullscreen, no Live Text analysis.
 * - **Nothing covers the artwork until there is a frame.** The artwork is
 *   drawn over this and fades out only on `onFirstFrame`, so a slow stream or
 *   a failed one leaves the picture where it was — never a black square.
