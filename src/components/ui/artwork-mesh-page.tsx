/**
 * SimpMusic's Apple Music page (`lib/artwork-mesh.ts`), drawn: the artwork's
 * colours as a mesh hung from `seam` — the y where the artwork's foot is —
 * with its first row held above it, behind the artwork, and the reference's
 * scrim over the whole of it.
 *
 * Fills its parent. Until the mesh is read, and for a cover that has none,
 * it is `fallback` — the page colour the screen already had — and the mesh
 * fades in over it rather than cutting in.
 *
 * The mesh is two images stretched by the platform's bilinear filter: a
 * 64×64 texture below the seam, its first row above. Drawn twice by the cover
 * viewer — once under the artwork, once over its foot inside a mask — which
 * is how the artwork dissolves into the page with no line where the colours
 * would have to match: they are the same pixels.
