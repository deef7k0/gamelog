        The circle is a fixed diameter by contract — 76dp on a profile, 30–54dp
        in a row — and it cannot grow with the OS text size without moving every
        layout it sits inside. So at large accessibility sizes the glyph grew and
        the box did not, and the letter clipped against its own clip mask.

        What makes freezing it correct rather than a regression is that this
        letter is **not text to read**. It is a stand-in for a face, and the
        person's actual name is always rendered beside it at a size that *does*
        scale — every call site pairs the two. Nothing is lost by holding the
        monogram still; the name carries the meaning.
