/**
 * The saturation floor `tone="vivid"` lifts a primary fill to.
 *
 * `accent.color` is M3's `primary` — the seed's hue at tone 60, with chroma
 * clamped to 48–72 so a fill is never neon. That is the right ceiling for a
 * colour that might appear several times on a page, and it is one step quieter
 * than the single button a screen is *about* wants to be: measured on real
 * seeds, a muted cover lands its primary around 0.45 HSL saturation, which on a
 * near-black page reads closer to slate than to the game's colour.
 *
 * 0.72 is a floor rather than a set point, so `saturate()` leaves an already
 * vivid extraction — DOOM's red at 0.84, a gold cover at 1.00 — exactly where it
 * was and only lifts the ones that arrived muted. It is deliberately short of
 * the 0.78 this was first set to: the only seed the two really disagree about is
 * a mid-green, which 0.78 takes to `#1AD156` — a neon that stops looking like
 * the game's colour and starts looking like a highlighter.
 *
 * Hue and HSL lightness are preserved, but relative luminance is not exactly, so
 * the ink is recomputed against the fill that actually ships rather than
 * inherited from `accent.ink`. Measured across eight real seeds at this floor:
 * ink-on-fill 5.45–8.87:1, fill-on-page 4.85–7.90:1. Nothing here is close to a
 * line, which is the point of lifting saturation rather than tone.

/**

 * black), a small semibold label in the middle. The variants change the label,
 * not the object:
 *
 *  - `primary`   the label a step brighter (`text`). The one thing on a screen
 *                you are most likely to want; at most one per screen.
 *  - `secondary` the label in `controlInk`, the reference's soft grey.
 *  - `ghost`     no fill at all — a text action, like the reference's
 *                "Connect". It gains a faint fill only while held.
 *  - `danger`    the same pill with a red label. Destructive must not look safe,
 *                and must not outshout the artwork beside it either.
 *
 * Choices are never drawn like this: a selectable control is outlined
 * (`useSelectable`, `<SelectionCard>`), so an action and a choice cannot be
 * mistaken for each other.
 *
 * **The one exception is `tone="vivid"`**, the game page's "Write a review":
 * the Material 3 cluster there keeps its own treatment, a pill filled with the
 * game's colour.
 *
 * **Every state is drawn, not faded.** Held, the fill brightens a step
 * (`controlPressed`) and the button sinks 3%. Focused from a keyboard, it wears
 * the accent's ring. Disabled, it is the reference's disabled "Join room": no
 * fill, a faint edge and a dimmed label — told apart by shape as well as by
 * brightness, and still readable enough to say why it is there.
 *
 * 52dp tall (60 when large, 36 when small — lifted to the tap floor by slop).
