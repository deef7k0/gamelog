 * The glass, as far as it can be had without a shader.
 *
 * SimpMusic's button is Kyant's liquid glass (`LiquidGlassContainer.kt`,
 * `drawInteractiveGlass`): what is behind it blurred by 8dp and bent through a
 * lens, darkened by a scrim of black, and edged with a rim of light that falls
 * from one side. The lens is a `RuntimeShader`; this app has no Skia, and a
 * circle 48 across is too small for refraction to be what anyone sees. What
 * reads as that button is the other three, and those are drawn:
 *
 *  - **The rim**: one dp of gradient round the edge, bright where the light
 *    lands (top left), nearly gone across the middle, lifting again at the far
 *    side. A uniform hairline is the outline of a button; a rim that changes
 *    round its circle is the edge of a piece of glass.
 *  - **The scrim**: 27% black — the reference's `lerp(0.12, 0.5, …)` at the
 *    mid luminance its static surfaces are drawn with.
 *  - **The sheen**: a faint light across the top-left of the pane, where the
 *    reference's highlight sits.
 *
 * White at fixed alphas, written out: these are light on glass, not a colour
 * of the app's, and they are the same over every page. Every stop that fades
 * ends on white at zero — Android interpolates a gradient unpremultiplied, and
 * a fade to `transparent` goes grey on the way.

 * numbers and says where in the reference's source each was read.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * A row 64 high under the status bar: a back chevron, the page's name in the
 * title step, the page's controls at the far end. **It is never a fixed
 * opaque strip.** It floats over the page with nothing behind it, and turns to
 * frosted glass — the page blurred, washed with the page's own colour — when
 * there is something under it to frost. Which of two ways it does that is
 * decided by the page:
 *
 *  - **A page that opens on a list or a form** (`<Screen insetHeader>`). The
 *    bar is there from the start, clear while the page is at its very top and
 *    frost the moment it is not; the two cross-fade over 300ms. The page uses
 *    a page scroller (`ui/page-scroll`) so the bar can tell.
 *  - **A page that opens on artwork** (no `insetHeader`). At rest there is no
 *    bar: a disc of glass in each corner, 48 across and 12 in, and they are
 *    part of the artwork — they scroll away with it. Once the header has gone
 *    under where the bar would be, the bar comes in from above, already frost,
 *    carrying the page's name. Tell it how tall the header is (`header`).
 *
 * Home's is a third, `<FoldingTopBar>` below.
 *
 * ## What this replaced
 *
 * For a long while there was no bar: only the disc, on every screen, pinned.
 * The bar before *that* was a full-width sheet of frost fixed across the top —
 * 111dp of an 844pt display, blurring the top of every piece of key art in an
 * app whose subject is artwork — and the disc was the answer to it. This is
 * the reference's answer to the same problem, and it keeps what the disc won:
 * nothing is drawn over artwork except two small circles, and a list page
 * gives up no more than it did. What it gives back is the page's name, which
 * no pushed screen had carried since.
 *
 * So **a screen's heading is its bar's `title`**, and a page that opens on a
 * list no longer prints a heading of its own under it.
 *
 * ## Android still needs a target
 *
 * A `<BlurView>` with a dimezis `blurMethod` and no `blurTarget` silently
 * falls back to a flat translucent slab. The target is the page content,
 * wrapped by `<Screen>` in `<BlurTargetView>` and passed here through
 * `useScreenChrome()`. Outside a `<Screen>` this still renders; it just loses
 * the blur on Android, and never frosts.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Screen edges={['bottom']} insetHeader topBar={<FrostedTopBar back title="Settings" />}>
 *   <PageScrollView>…</PageScrollView>
 * </Screen>
 * ```

 *    nothing between, so it is never a fade over a blur.
 *  - **It paints its own grey over the blur, in proportion to the strength.**
 *    So it is asked for a small strength and the radius is made up through
 *    `blurReductionFactor`; the wash is then the only tint.
 *
 * Every style reads `pulse` and carries a transform, and the strength moves by
 * a hundredth on alternate renders — see `usePulse`.
