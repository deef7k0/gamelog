 * line has a visible corner at each end, which on artwork reads as a crease.
 *
 * This replaced three clipped copies at increasing blur radius. That version
 * left a hard step at each band boundary: rendered at the real 390×321 against
 * high-contrast art the seams were plainly visible rectangles, and adding bands
 * did not converge — twelve looked worse than three, because every extra band
 * is another edge rather than a smaller one. A mask has no bands to seam.
 *
 * **Exported for a masthead that cannot call `<HeroArt>` itself.** The
 * collection's was one, while its artwork was a 2×2 mosaic rather than a single
 * image: a second technique tuned by eye would have drifted from this one on the
 * first retune. That masthead is one cover under a plain scrim now, and nothing
 * outside this file reads these.
