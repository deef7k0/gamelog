/**
 * A single line of text that scrolls to reveal its end, then loops.
 *
 * For the one string beside a pair of round actions whose length is not ours: a
 * game's title. "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" does not fit beside
 * two round buttons at any type size the block can afford, and the alternatives
 * are both worse — wrapping to two lines moves everything under it by a line
 * depending on the game, and truncating loses the half of a subtitle that
 * distinguishes one edition from another.
 *
 * ## How it measures
 *
 * A second, off-screen copy at `left: -9999` inside a 9999dp box, where nothing
 * constrains it, reports its natural width; the visible window reports the space
 * available. The difference is the travel. This is two `onLayout` callbacks
 * rather than an effect — a layout event is an event, so the state it sets is
 * not the setState-in-an-effect the React Compiler rules forbid.
 *
 * ## When it does nothing
 *
 * A title that fits is not animated at all, which is the overwhelming majority
 * of them. Neither is any title under Reduce Motion: a looping horizontal
 * crawl is precisely the vestibular trigger that setting exists for, and the
 * fallback is an ellipsis.
 *
 * Moved out of Surprise Me when the review page took the same title row.
