 * A game's Overview has three of these — Ratings, and the two "Played by"
 * squares — from the owner's reference for it, a film's page in Letterboxd
 * (2026-10-09), in the review card's material like every card in the app
 * (`useCardMaterial`, 2026-10-20): its corner, its hairline, fifteen in, the
 * card shadow — and on a game's page the game's dark tone for a fill.
 *
 * ## It is not for rows of games
 *
 * For one build it was: every row of covers in the app sat in one of these,
 * heading and all, as the sections on Letterboxd's home do. The owner saw that
 * on a phone and had it undone — "remove the cards and leave the game's rails
 * on their own. They should not be inside a card." A row of games is a heading
 * on the page and its covers under it (`<HomeSection>` or `<Section>` over a
 * `<GameCoverRail>`). Do not give this a rail to hold.
