 *
 * This is the most-used animation in the app — every button, tab, chip, poster
 * and row goes through it — and it was the largest single gap in a claim
 * PRODUCT.md makes: *"motion respects the reduced-motion setting."*
 *
 * **It is not switched off, and that distinction is the whole point.** A scale
 * is spatial movement, which is what the setting asks to be spared; but the
 * press feedback it carries is the only confirmation that a tap registered at
 * all, and removing it would answer an accessibility preference by deleting an
 * accessibility affordance. So the *material* changes and the *meaning* stays:
 * opacity instead of translation, which is exactly the crossfade substitution
 * both platform references prescribe.
