/**
 * A shelf that rises into place the first time it scrolls into view: a fade
 * and a 16dp rise on a long, soft landing (`SHELF_REVEAL`).
 *
 * `<Section>`, `<HomeSection>` and `<Panel>` are built on it, so a page's
 * shelves do it without the page wrapping each one — which it could not do
 * without a box of its own round a section that renders nothing, and with it
 * a gap in the page's `gap`. Outside a `<RevealScope>` it is a plain `View`
 * with the same style, and nothing about the layout differs.
 *
 * ## What it never does
 *
 * - **Hide what is on screen.** A shelf is hidden only when its first layout
 *   finds it wholly below the display; one already in sight is simply there.
 *   So opening a page animates nothing, and a page restored half-scrolled
 *   shows what it showed.
 * - **Wait somewhere it has been moved into view.** It re-reads where it is on
 *   every scroll, on its own layout, and when the page reports content moving
 *   without a scroll (`ScreenChrome.layout`: a list growing, a synopsis
 *   closing) — events, never a timer, so a page at rest wakes nothing.
 * - **Lose its end.** The fade is a CSS transition on a React prop, so a
 *   dropped frame cannot leave it at its first value (CLAUDE.md § Gotchas).
 * - **Move under Reduce Motion**: there it is always simply there.
 *
 * A hidden shelf is still in the accessibility tree: a screen reader moving
 * onto it scrolls it into view, and that is a scroll.
