/**
 * Body copy with the two emphases people actually type: `**bold**` and
 * `*italic*`.
 *
 * ## Why a hand-rolled parser and not a markdown library
 *
 * Because this is not markdown and must not become it. The input is a
 * collection's description, written in a `<TextField multiline>` by someone
 * describing a shelf of games — the useful part of markdown here is emphasis,
 * and every other feature is a liability. Headings would put a second type scale
 * inside a caption. Links would need sanitising, resolving and a safe tap
 * target. Images would let one collection's blurb push a wall of tiles off the
 * screen. Tables have nowhere to go on a 390dp phone.
 *
 * A parser that knows only two rules also degrades the right way: text that is
 * not valid emphasis is text. An unclosed `**` renders as two asterisks — which
 * is what the writer typed, so they can see it and fix it — where a real
 * markdown renderer would either eat it or swallow the rest of the paragraph
 * into a bold run.
 *
 * `react-native-markdown-display` and friends also want a `rules` map of ~30
 * node types and ship a parser several times the size of this file, to render
 * two of them.
 *
 * ## The grammar, in full
 *
 * - `**text**` → semibold. Not `bold` (700): this runs inside `body` and
 *   `bodySmall`, where 700 against 400 is a shout rather than an emphasis, and
 *   700 is reserved for the two largest steps of the scale.
 * - `*text*` → italic.
 * - `***text***` → both, as its own marker rather than as a consequence of the
 *   other two. Tried first, because `**` would otherwise claim two of the three
 *   asterisks and leave a literal one stranded.
 * - A marker with only whitespace between it (`**`, `* *`) is not emphasis and
 *   stays literal, which is what stops a row of asterisks in ASCII art from
 *   becoming an invisible formatting instruction.
 *
 * Emphasis does not span a blank line. There is no paragraph model here — the
 * string renders as one `<Text>` and newlines are newlines — but the pattern
 * refuses to match across `\n\n`, so a stray `*` in one paragraph cannot
 * italicise everything down to the next one.
 *
 * ## Nesting has to name the combined face
 *
 * A `<Text>` inside a `<Text>` inherits `fontFamily`, and setting it *replaces*
 * the parent's rather than combining with it — there is no `fontStyle` axis to
 * fall back on, because italic is a separate family here (see `FontFamily`). So
 * `**bold with *italic* inside**` cannot be rendered by nesting an italic run
 * inside a semibold one: the inner run would come out regular italic, quietly
 * dropping the weight. The active emphasis is therefore threaded down the
 * recursion and each run names the one face that expresses all of it.

 * first, closing the outer italic against the wrong asterisk and emitting
 * `<i>italic with **bold</i>* inside*`. Position-first with length as the

/**
 * Match one emphasis run: `<token>content<token>`.
 *
 * Three guards, and the first is the subtle one.
 *
 * **`(?![*\s])` after the opening marker, `(?!\*)` after the closing one.** A
 * marker may not sit against another asterisk, which is what stops a short
 * marker from biting into a longer delimiter run. Without it the lazy `*` in
 * `*italic with **bold** inside*` closes on the *opening* asterisk of `**bold**`
 * — the classic failure of a regex-based emphasis parser, and the reason real
 * markdown tokenises delimiter runs instead. Requiring both ends to be isolated
 * gets the same answer here without a tokeniser, because the grammar is two
 * rules deep rather than thirty. It is also why `****` and `*****x*****` stay
 * literal rather than resolving to something arbitrary.
 *
 * **`(?![*\s])` and the trailing `[^\s*]`** are the "no empty, no
 * whitespace-only" rule: `* *` and `** **` are text.
 *
 * **`[\s\S]` with `(?!\n\n)`** — a run may cross a single newline, because a
 * sentence wrapped mid-emphasis is ordinary typing, but never a blank line, so a
 * stray asterisk cannot italicise everything down to the next paragraph.
 *
 * Non-greedy, so `*a* and *b*` is two runs rather than one containing
 * `a* and *b`.
