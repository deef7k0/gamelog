 *    50   asleep in it              80   on the edge of the seat, leaning in
 *                                  100   on his feet
 * ```
 *
 * The owner's brief (2026-10-12): five drawings for the ratings, after the
 * little man a newspaper rates films with — a gaming chair for the chair, the
 * man alone at the top, and no screen anywhere.
 *
 * **It is drawn in three places and no others**, the owner's ruling on first
 * seeing it everywhere: the ratings graph on a game's page, the same graph in
 * the reviews sheet (`<ScoreSummary>` — with the number, `<FiguredScore>`),
 * and a review's own page (`<ScoreMeter>`). A review card keeps its square
 * with the number in it. Do not put it on a card.
 *
 * ## Two colours, and where each comes from
 *
 * The chair, the controller and the small marks round him (the z's, the
 * sparks) are the **score's own colour** — `scoreColor()`, the one ramp, so an
 * 88 is the same green here as its number is everywhere else. The man is the
 * page's ink. Score is one of the three places colour may come from in this
 * app, and this spends it on the thing that is about the game, not on him.
 *
 * ## The drawing is the second carrier
 *
 * Colour is never the only carrier here. This leans on posture: an empty
 * chair, a sleeper and a man on his feet are three shapes before they are
 * three colours. What a drawing cannot say is the exact figure — a 76 and an
 * 88 are both a man leaning in over his controller — which is why the number is
 * printed beside it or under it in every place it is drawn, and is always what
 * a screen reader is told.
