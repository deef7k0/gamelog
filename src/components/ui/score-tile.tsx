/**
 * A score as a coloured square.
 *
 * **Square, with the corner just taken off.** It ran at `Radius.none` for a
 * while and at `Radius.image` (4dp) before that. 4 was the wrong number in the
 * other direction: at 44–84dp a 4dp corner does not read as "rounded", it reads
 * as one corner having gone soft while the rest look sharp. `Radius.lg` (8) is
 * the step where the softening is legible as a deliberate shape at every one of
 * the three sizes, and it is still far from `Radius.control` (6)… which is to
 * say it is *near* it, and that is the one thing to keep an eye on: the tile
 * must not start reading as a button. It does not, because it holds a numeral
 * rather than a word and never takes a press state.
 *
 * The shape is still doing work: it is the one element on these surfaces that is
 * not a fully rounded rectangle or a pill, which is what separates the score
 * from the controls around it without spending a second colour on the
 * distinction.
 *
 * ## The colour
 *
 * `scoreColor()` and nothing else. Score is one of the three sources CLAUDE.md
 * permits colour to come from, and this aliases onto the existing ramp rather
 * than inventing a hex — an 88 is the same green here, in a metadata row and on
 * a review page. The ink is `readableInk()`, so green and amber take the dark
 * number they need while red keeps a light one; a single fixed ink fails on at
 * least one band.
 *
 * ## Why the word is under the number
 *
 * The verdict is the second carrier. A band is a colour and a number, and
 * neither survives a protanopic reader alone — the word does, and `labelFor()`
 * is already the app's name for it.

/**
 * The score as a small filled **rectangle**: "61 FAIR", the number and its word
 * on one line.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `<ScoreTile>`
 *
 * `<ScoreTile>` is a square, and a square is what you draw where the score
 * stands in for artwork — a review row's leading slot, a review page's
 * masthead. This is the opposite situation: a fact on a metadata line, sharing a
 * row with a platform mark and a playtime. A square there is a tall object in a
 * line of short ones and it sets the row's height; a rectangle sits *in* the
 * line, which is what a run of facts needs.
 *
 * It is also not `<ScoreLine>` — bare coloured digits and a word, no fill. That
 * is right where the score is the only coloured thing around. Here it shares a
 * row with a platform's brand mark and a trophy, and a fill is what keeps the
 * verdict from reading as a third icon.
 *
 * ## The colour
 *
 * `scoreColor()` fills it and `readableInk()` writes on it — the same pair
 * `<ScoreTile>` uses, for the same reason: green and amber need a dark number
 * while red needs a light one, and a single fixed ink fails on at least one
 * band. Aliasing the existing ramp rather than inventing a hex is the house rule
 * for anything that is data.
 *
 * The word is inside the fill, not beside it. Colour is never the only carrier
 * here (CLAUDE.md), and "61" alone asks the reader to supply a scale.
 */
/**
 * `narrow` is the chip as it appears in a card's top bar, beside a username:
 * a 9/12 band against the token's 10/13, and tighter side padding.
 *
 * ## It prints the whole word
 *
 * It used to print an abbreviation — MASTER, OUTSTAND, EXCELL — through a
 * `shortLabelFor` that has since been deleted. That was the right call for the
 * layout it was written for, where the chip lived under the box art in a column
 * fixed at `BOX_ART_WIDTH`, 84dp, and "MASTERPIECE" did not fit. The relayout
 * that moved it into a top bar spanning the card removed the column and kept the
 * abbreviation, so for a long while the feed printed "EXCELL" in a row with
 * room to spare.
 *
 * The row is also what guarantees the room now. The chip's block is
 * `flexShrink: 0` and the author beside it is `flex: 1, minWidth: 0`, so on a
 * narrow screen a long display name truncates and the verdict never does — which
 * is the right way round: a name survives an ellipsis, "EXCELL…" does not.
 *
 * ## The 9px band is a deliberate exception to the 10px floor
 *
 * `Type`'s note is explicit that 10 is the floor and that `caption` and `label`
 * must not go below it. That rule is about *running text you have to read* — a
 * timestamp, a count, a chip in a metadata row. This is a two-to-eleven letter
 * uppercase word on a filled block at `readableInk` contrast, and it is the
 * **third** carrier on the object after the number and the colour. The chip is
 * the one member of a crowded row — avatar, name of unknown length, platform
 * mark, playtime — whose width it can choose, and the point it gives back is
 * the name's.
 *
 * The exception is local to this style — the token is untouched, so nothing else
 * in the app moves.
