 * consistently larger than the number inside it — a two-character fact wearing
 * an 80px badge. The verdict colour does everything the box was doing: good,
 * mixed or bad is legible before the digits are.
 *
 * The three ramp colours are the one exception to the app's single-accent rule,
 * and they earn it by being *data*. They appear on numerals and their labels,
 * never on a control, a fill or an edge.
