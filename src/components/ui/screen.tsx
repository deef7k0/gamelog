            On iOS and the web this is a plain `<View>` — those platforms sample
            whatever is behind a translucent layer without being told. On Android
            it is a native `BlurTarget`, the only thing `expo-blur` can read
            from; see `hooks/use-screen-chrome`. The bar is deliberately outside
            it.

            **The page fill lives here, not on the view above.** Android's blur
            renders this subtree and nothing else, so a background painted on an
            ancestor is not part of what the bar samples — on a screen with no
            `backdrop` the glass would come back with whatever the window's own
            drawable happens to be rather than `background`. It also keeps the
            backdrop over the fill and under the safe area, which is what
            `backdrop` is for; `SafeAreaView` stays transparent and does insets
            and nothing else.
