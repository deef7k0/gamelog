 * studio banner lay it over the bottom 70% of their artwork, where the page
 * colour takes over. Every stop is the page colour at an explicit alpha, never
 * `'transparent'`, which Android's gradient fades through black.
 *
 * Positioned by the caller (`style`); draws nothing it can be touched through.
