 *
 * Read from its source, not its screenshots: `ui/component/ChipGroup.kt`
 * (`Chip`, an `ElevatedFilterChip`) and the rows under the top bars of
 * `HomeScreen.kt`, `LibraryScreen.kt` and `SearchScreen.kt`. So:
 *
 * - **A full pill, 32 high, 16 at each side** — Material's filter chip.
 * - **Unselected: no fill at all, a 1dp `outlineVariant` edge, the label in
 *   `onSurfaceVariant`.** No fill because the row mostly sits over a page or
 *   artwork, where a solid pill reads as a slab punched over it; the edge is
 *   what carries the shape.
 * - **Selected: a solid `primary` fill and its `onPrimary` label, no check.**
 *   The solid against the see-through is the selection, filled versus empty,
 *   so it survives without colour vision; a check would widen the chosen chip
 *   and shove the row sideways under the finger. **The fill pours** in from
 *   the chip's middle (`<PaintFill>`) — the owner's rule for every control that
 *   goes from an outline to solid (2026-10-15) — and drains from the one left.
 * - **The label is Material's `labelLarge`**: 14, medium, sentence case.
 * - **4 apart, 15 in from the edge**, scrolling when it overflows.
 *
 * The roles are the accent's own M3 set (`accent.m3`): the house blue's off a
 * game's screens, the game's palette on them — as SimpMusic's are its seed's.
 *
 * **This replaced a wash and caps.** The selected tab was a 14% wash of the
 * accent with its label in the accent, every other tab bare muted type, and
 * every label uppercase and tracked out. The underline before that is gone for
 * the reason it always was: a rule needs an edge to sit on.
