/**
 * The labels a moderator can put on a game (migration 0034).
 *
 * A label is curation, not a statistic: nothing computes it and no number of
 * ratings earns it. A moderator sets it by hand — from the game's own page, or
 * from the label's list — and the app shows it as a badge on the game's cover
 * and in the game page's stats strip.
 *
 * **This list and 0034's CHECK on `game_labels.label` must match**, and
 * `game-labels.test.ts` reads the migration to hold them together. Adding a
 * label is an entry here, the same word in a new migration's CHECK, and — if it
 * has its own artwork — a badge; nothing else in the app enumerates them.
