/**
 * A mood's or a genre's tile at the foot of Home — SimpMusic's "Moods &
 * Genres" browse card, read from its source (`MoodCategoryCard.kt`,
 * `PlaylistThumbnail.kt`'s `playlistTitleGradient`, `UIExt.kt`'s
 * `angledGradientBackground`, and the grid in `SearchScreen.kt` that lays them
 * out two to a row). The owner's direction (2026-10-22): "blocks in a gradient
 * color with an image from a song".
 *
 * Pure — no React Native, no network — so `npm test` holds every number to the
 * reference and every ink to AA. `components/home/mood-tiles` draws it.
 *
 * ## What the reference is, in one breath
 *
 * A 2:1 block with a 10dp corner, filled with a two-colour gradient at 45°,
 * the name in the top-left in white over two lines at most, and **one cover
 * tilted 25° off the bottom-right corner** — offset 8 right and 12 down
 * *before* it is rotated, so the tile's own clip cuts it into a diagonal
 * instead of pasting a square inside the card. Two to a row, twelve apart. The
 * cover is fetched per tile and arrives late; the tile is built to look
 * finished without it.
 *
 * ## The two departures, and why
 *
 * 1. **The gradient is the item's own hue, not a hash of its name.** The
 *    reference derives two unrelated hues from `title.hashCode()` — a
 *    deterministic colour that means nothing. This app already has a colour
 *    that means something for exactly these items: a genre's identity hue
 *    (`constants/identity`, the colour that genre's games' pages are lit in)
 *    and a mood's own `hue`. Inventing a hex is against the colour rule
 *    (CLAUDE.md § Conventions: "Add a meaning by aliasing, never by inventing
 *    a hex"), so a tile is **its own hue twice**: deep at the corner the name
 *    starts in, rich at the corner the cover sits in, the second stop turned
 *    `GRADIENT_TURN` along the ramp so the block reads as two colours rather
 *    than one dimmed.
 *
 * 2. **Both stops are anchored by measured luminance, so the name is white on
 *    every tile.** The reference fills from a bright `HSV(h, 0.7, 0.9)` and
 *    sets the title in `Color.White` whatever that lands on — on its yellows
 *    that is about 1.5:1. Here the name's box is most of a 2:1 tile, so there
 *    is no band to keep clear: white has to hold *everywhere* on the
 *    gradient. Fixing the two stops at a **lightness** cannot do that (yellow
 *    and blue are nowhere near each other in luminance at one lightness), so
 *    each stop is placed at a luminance instead — `atLuminance` keeps the hue
 *    and the saturation and finds the rest — which is what makes every tile as
 *    vivid as its own hue allows while measuring the same against white. A
 *    blue tile comes out darker than its number asks for because a saturated
 *    blue cannot be that bright; that is the hue, not a mistake.
 *
 * **No badge.** The reference stamps each tile with a white disc carrying
 * SimpMusic's monochrome mark at 20% — the same badge its artwork-less
 * playlist thumbnails wear, which are surfaces people screenshot and share.
 * There is no GameLog logo (§ A review in one sentence: the share card's
 * controller is a stand-in), and twenty stand-in brand dots inside the app
 * would be twenty pieces of clutter telling somebody which app they are
 * already in. The name's right-hand padding stays regardless, because the
 * reference's own comment says what it is for: the tilted cover's bounding
 * box, not the badge.
