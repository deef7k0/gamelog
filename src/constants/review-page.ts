/**
 * A review's own page, in numbers.
 *
 * Pure — its one import is a neighbour, by relative path — so `npm test`
 * loads it.
 *
 * ## The owner's screenshot, from their phone (2026-10-17, the third pass)
 *
 * "I've taken this from my phone, so you should be able to land the sizes 1:1…
 * FOLLOW THE SCREENSHOT, THE EXACT SAME STYLE, SIZES, GAPS." A review in a
 * music app, 720px across a 360dp phone: **two pixels a dp**, exactly. Every
 * number here is the screenshot's pixels halved, and `review-page.test.ts`
 * lays the page out from them and holds each line to where the screenshot has
 * it.
 *
 * Top to bottom: the game's **square** art as the hero, full width,
 * dissolving, and half the display tall as a collection's is (2026-10-21,
 * the one size here that is not the screenshot's); a row of the
 * writer's large face, their name with the score at the far end of its line,
 * the game's name in heavy type and "by" its developer; the quote, centred,
 * in quotation marks; the date; the review; how it was played, where the
 * screenshot has "Translate to English"; the platform, where it has the track
 * the listener liked; the like and share; "Replies"; and the reply composer
 * docked at the foot of the screen.
 *
 * The type is Poppins, the app's, so each size is the one whose letters stand
 * as tall as the screenshot's — matched by x-height and capital height — and
 * the screenshot's face, a little narrower, fits a few more words a line.
