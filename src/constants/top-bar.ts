/**
 * The top bar's measurements and the arithmetic of how it moves — SimpMusic's,
 * read from its source at the owner's direction ("look at how SimpMusic does
 * their top bar… the animation when it scrolls, the size, how it looks").
 *
 * Pure: no React, no React Native, nothing imported. `<FrostedTopBar>`, the
 * header-height hooks and `npm test` all read these, so the bar that is drawn,
 * the room a screen leaves for it and the numbers the tests hold cannot drift.
 *
 * ## What the reference does, and where each part was read
 *
 * Every bar in SimpMusic is Material 3's small `TopAppBar` with a transparent
 * container — a back arrow, a title in `titleMedium`, icon buttons at the far
 * end — and it is never a fixed opaque strip. It behaves one of three ways:
 *
 *  1. **A page that opens on a list or a form** (`NotificationScreen.kt`): the
 *     bar floats over the list, clear while the list is at its very top, and
 *     frosted the moment it is not. The two cross-fade over 300ms.
 *  2. **A page that opens on artwork** (`AlbumScreen.kt`, `ArtistScreen.kt`,
 *     `PlaylistScreen.kt`): no bar at all at rest — glass discs, 48 across and
 *     12 from the corner, that are part of the header and scroll away with it.
 *     Once the header has gone a frosted bar carrying the page's name comes in
 *     from above (`fadeIn() + slideInVertically()`).
 *  3. **Home** (`HomeScreen.kt`): the first kind, and its row also folds away
 *     while the page is being read downward and comes back on the way up
 *     (`isScrollingUp`), leaving the frost over the status bar.
 *
 * The functions here run on the UI thread, inside worklets. **A worklet's
 * parameter default cannot name a constant of this module** (CLAUDE.md
 * § Gotchas), so none of them has a default.
