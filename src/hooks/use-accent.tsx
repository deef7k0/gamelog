/**
 * The accent in force for this part of the tree.
 *
 * Context rather than props, for one specific reason: the controls that should
 * take a game's colour are nowhere near the screen that knows what game it is.
 * `<Button>`, `<TabBar>` and `<Chip>` are shared primitives used by forty
 * screens, and threading `accent` down to each of them would put a prop on
 * every one of those call sites to change the behaviour of four.
 *
 * **The default is the house blue**, so nothing changes anywhere until a screen
 * opts in. `<AccentProvider>` wraps a game's page — and only a game's page, plus
 * the screens that are about one game (log, review, achievements). The
 * feed, search, news and profile stay on `primary` deliberately: twenty games in
 * a list is twenty hues, and a scrolling fruit salad is not identity, it is
 * noise. Colour identifies a game when you are looking at *that game*.
 *
 * **Every game screen can be neutral instead** — Settings → Game colours
 * (`useGameColours`), the owner's switch (2026-10-20). Off, a provider hands
 * down the app's own page and `surface` cards, with the owner's grey
 * (`gameNeutral`, #CACACA) as the accent where `neutral` gives the house
 * white. The components did not
 * learn about it: they read the same role names either way (`accentRoles`),
 * and the cards read `tonal` to choose their fill (`useCardMaterial`).

 * fail: the network is down, a legacy Steam URL 404s, or the art genuinely has
 * no dominant hue (Celeste's cover is several colours and no one of them wins).
 * The genre ramp is what catches all of that, so a page always has a colour and
 * never a grey hole where one should be.
 *
 * The extraction is a TanStack Query keyed on the URL, so it runs once per game
 * per session and is served from `AsyncStorage` on every later visit — see
 * `use-album-art-color.ts`. While it resolves, the genre hue is already on
 * screen, which is why the page never opens colourless and then lurches: the two

   * decoder only where that module cannot load, which is Expo Go. And it seeds
   * from the artwork's **raw dominant colour** rather than from the normalised
   * accent hue that `extractArtworkColor` also returns.
   *
   * That second one is the important one now. The normalisation existed to drag
   * a muted average up to something usable as a button fill, because the old
   * ramp used the hue directly at a fixed saturation. A Material 3 palette does
   * that job itself and does it better: `TONAL_SPOT` rebuilds the primary
   * palette at chroma 36 whatever the seed's own chroma was. Pre-saturating the
