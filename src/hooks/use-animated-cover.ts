/**
 * A game's animated cover in one shape — `status`, the file, and `retry` —
 * remembered on the device, **"there is none" included**.
 *
 * The owner's request (2026-10-20), and its one rule about asking: "If the
 * user has already seen that no animated cover exists for this game (cached),
 * the animated query is not done every time." Very few games have one, so the
 * common answer is "none", and it costs as much to find out as a hit — a
 * SteamGridDB search, a grids request, an IGDB request. So every answer is
 * kept for a month (`TTL_MS`), per game and shape: a square and a portrait are
 * looked up and remembered independently.
 *
 * A module store read through `useSyncExternalStore`, as `use-square-cover`
 * is and for its reasons: one map for every screen, read on the first render,
 * so a game whose answer is known draws it without a request or a frame of
 * "loading". Not TanStack Query: a query cache entry is a request per screen,
 * this is a cache with subscribers.
 *
 * Four things keep a lookup from happening at all:
 *
 * - **Reduce Motion.** Never an animated cover, so never a request: `idle`.
 * - **Animated artwork off** (Settings, onboarding — `useAnimatedArtwork`):
 *   `idle` too, unless the cover was asked for by hand (`explicit`, the game
 *   page's Animated button).
 * - **`enabled: false`** — the game page asks only once its Animated button
 *   is pressed; Surprise Me only for the cards either side of the one in
 *   front. A known answer is still read while it is false, so a button can
 *   say "none" before anybody presses it.
 * - **A known answer**, on disk from any earlier visit.
 *
 * A file that fails to play (`reportFailure`) is "none" for the rest of the
 * session and logged — but not written to disk: a dropped connection is not
 * evidence the game has no animated cover.
