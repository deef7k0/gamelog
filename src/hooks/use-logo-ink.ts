 * What a platform's or studio's logo is made of, remembered across launches,

 *
 * The same shape as `use-square-cover`, for the same reason: the answer has to
 * be known *before the first paint*. A logo drawn on a plate and then moved off
 * it a beat later — or drawn dark and then lightened — is a flash on every
 * tile of a directory of two hundred, every time it mounts. So this is a
 * module store persisted to AsyncStorage and read through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`:
 *
 *  - The first time the app ever sees a logo, `resolved` is false and the
 *    caller draws nothing in its frame.
 *  - The measurement — **including "could not be read"** — goes to disk.
 *  - Every sighting after that resolves on the first render: no request, no
 *    decode, no change of treatment.
 *
 * A measurement is one ~2 KB request and a decode of at most 8,100 pixels in
 * JavaScript, a few milliseconds, once per logo.
