/**
 * What a floating top bar needs to know about the page underneath it.
 *
 * Published by `<Screen>` and read by `<FrostedTopBar>`, which is rendered
 * through the `topBar` slot and therefore sits inside this provider even though
 * the *screen* creates the element.
 *
 *  - **`blurTarget`** — the view whose pixels the bar blurs. iOS and the web
 *    sample whatever is behind a translucent layer for free; Android does not,
 *    and `expo-blur` on SDK 57 makes that explicit: a `<BlurView>` with no
 *    `blurTarget` silently downgrades to `blurMethod: 'none'` and renders a flat
 *    translucent slab. So `<Screen>` wraps its content in `<BlurTargetView>` and
 *    hands the ref down here.
 *  - **`modal`** — whether this page is a sheet, which changes where the bar's
 *    content sits. See `useTopBarInset`.
 *  - **`scrollY`** — how far the page is scrolled, on the UI thread. It is what
 *    turns the bar to frost, carries the glass discs away with the artwork and
 *    brings the pinned bar in.
 *  - **`background`** — the page's fill, which the frost is washed with.
 *  - **`insetHeader`** — whether the page keeps the bar's row clear. One that
 *    does not opens on artwork, and gets discs where a bar would be.
 *
 * ## Who writes `scrollY`
 *
 * The page's own scroller, through `usePageScroll()` — `<PageScrollView>`,
 * `<PageFlatList>` and `<PageSectionList>` in `ui/page-scroll`. The value is
 * made here and not by the screen because the screen is *above* `<Screen>` in
 * the tree: it creates the scroller's element, but the scroller renders under
 * this provider, where it can read the context. So a screen says nothing about
 * scrolling to its bar; it uses a page scroller and the two find each other.
 * (The value used to be the screen's — `useTopBarScroll()`, passed to the bar
 * as a prop — and eleven screens ended up carrying a handler nothing read.)
 *
 * ## Why the target is state and not a `useRef`
 *
 * `BlurView` resolves the target in `componentDidMount` and again in
 * `componentDidUpdate`, comparing `prevProps.blurTarget?.current` against the
 * current one. A plain `useRef` is filled *after* the first render and never
 * triggers a second, so the comparison never runs and the blur stays
 * unconfigured for the life of the screen. Holding the native view in state
 * forces the one extra render that lets `componentDidUpdate` see it.
