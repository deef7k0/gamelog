 * The studio's banner art: the catalogue's choice once it has one, and until
 * then the one this device showed last time.
 *
 * The banner is chosen from the catalogue, and the page colour is read from the
 * banner, so on every visit both waited for two IGDB requests — and on a cold
 * start, for the whole catalogue again. The URL is all it takes to skip that:
 * the art is in expo-image's disk cache and its colour in
 * `extractDominantColor`'s store, so a studio opened before paints its banner
 * and its colour from the device while the catalogue refreshes behind them.
 *
 * A first visit has nothing remembered and waits, as before. A catalogue whose
 * choice has moved on — a new release out-reviewing the old banner — replaces
 * the remembered art when it arrives, and is what the next visit opens on.
 *
 * `current` is `undefined` while the catalogue is loading, which is the only
 * time the remembered art stands in; `null` is the catalogue's answer that
 * there is no banner, and is kept, never papered over with an old one.
