/**
 * The Reviews / Collections / People tabs.
 *
 * **Two generations of ranking live here.** 0013's functions (`popular_reviews`,
 * `popular_users`…) count every like there has ever been. 0038's
 * (`review_popularity`, `member_popularity`) count activity inside a period,
 * optionally among the viewer's circle and in the languages they read — how
 * Letterboxd's API documents its own (CLAUDE.md § Discovery). The newer ones
 * are what the screens ask for; the older ones are what they fall back to on a
 * database that has not run 0038, so they stay.
 *
 * Every function here is two round trips on purpose. The 0013 functions answer
 * only "which ids, in what order, with what number" — PostgREST cannot order a
 * resource by an aggregate over an embedded one, so the ranking has to happen
 * in SQL — and then the rows themselves come back through the same selects and
 * embeds the rest of the app uses. The alternative was composing
 * `LogWithRelations` inside a SQL function, which is a second definition of
 * what a review is, in a language where nothing would tell us when it drifted.
 *
 * Postgres does not promise to preserve the function's ordering through the
 * follow-up `in (…)` query, so every one of these re-sorts in memory against
 * the rank it asked for. Do not remove those sorts: they look redundant right
 * up until a query plan changes.
