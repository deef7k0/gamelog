/**
 * The dominant colour of a piece of box art, read from the actual pixels.
 *
 * ## Why this is done in JavaScript
 *
 * Reading pixels normally means a native module (`react-native-image-colors`),
 * and a native module means a development build — which this project does not
 * have: it runs in Expo Go. So the image is fetched as bytes and decoded by
 * `jpeg-js`, which is pure JavaScript with no dependencies and therefore works
 * unchanged in Expo Go, on a device, and on the web.
 *
 * That is affordable only because IGDB publishes a thumbnail. `t_thumb` is
 * 90×90 and around 3 KB; decoding it is roughly 8,100 pixels, which is nothing.
 * Pointing this at `t_cover_big` — let alone the 1080p artwork — would be a
 * different proposition entirely, so `swatchUrl` below rewrites the size in the
 * URL rather than trusting whatever the caller had on hand.
 *
 * ## What "dominant" means here
 *
 * Not "most common pixel". A cover is mostly sky, mostly concrete or mostly
 * night, so the modal colour of almost every game is a desaturated grey-blue and
 * every page would look the same — which is the failure this whole feature
 * exists to avoid. What we want is the colour a person would *name* if asked
 * what colour the box is: the one that is both plentiful and vivid.
 *
 * So pixels vote into **hue** bins, weighted by saturation and by how mid-toned
 * they are, and near-black and near-white are dropped before they can vote.
 * Watch Dogs 2's cover is pale sky and grey rubble around a blue jacket: it
 * resolves to blue at a 51% share. DOOM resolves red, Cyberpunk yellow, Portal 2
 * blue, Elden Ring gold. Celeste resolves nothing at all — its best hue holds
 * 20%, under the confidence floor — and correctly falls back to its genre.

 * black of the rubble, because dark pixels crowd into very few buckets while the
 * blue of the sky and the jacket spreads across dozens. Asking "which hue is
 * this box art" instead of "which exact colour repeats most" is both the
 * question a person actually means and the one that survives a gradient.
