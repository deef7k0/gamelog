 * review — the game page, Surprise Me, the profile's quick log and the log
 * form itself — and those are four places, not one.

/**
 * Whether a game is still in the future.
 *
 * Derived at render from `releaseDate` rather than stored, which is what makes
 * the page "update itself": the game query has a 30-minute `staleTime`, so the
 * first visit after launch day refetches, the date is no longer ahead of now,
 * and every hidden control reappears. No release-tracking service, no webhook,
 * no polling — the answer was always in the data IGDB already returns.
 *
 * A missing date means *unknown*, not unreleased. A game with no announced date
 * keeps its actions rather than being locked out on a technicality.
