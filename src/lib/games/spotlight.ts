/**
 * Which games Search opens on — the slider at the head of Discover — and what
 * each slide says about its date.
 *
 * Pure: no React Native and no network, so `npm test` covers it. The request
 * is `getSpotlight` in `igdb.ts`; this is everything it decides afterwards.
 *
 * ## The four slides, and whose words they are
 *
 * The owner's (2026-10-09): "2 of the most popular games released this month",
 * then "the most anticipated game coming soon" as a countdown, then a door to
 * the release calendar. Each of the first three is a piece of landscape art
 * with the game's name and one developer.
 *
 * ## Ranked as the calendar ranks
 *
 * `calendarWeight` — follows before release plus ratings after — is already
 * the app's one statement of "the big games of the month", and the calendar is
 * where the fourth slide leads. Two rankings would let the slider open on a
 * game the calendar it points at does not think is notable.
 *
 * ## A month is thin on its first days
 *
 * On the 2nd nothing has "released this month" but whatever came out
 * yesterday. So the window reaches back thirty days, and a game from this
 * month always goes ahead of one from the tail of the last: the slide is "new",
 * which both are, and never claims a month it cannot fill.
