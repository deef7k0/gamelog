/**
 * Apple's key colour — `keyColor` on an Apple Music artist, the iTunes 11
 * background behind an open album — ported for the hero of a game, a studio
 * and a collection.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * A key colour is not the colour of the picture. It is the colour the picture
 * *ends in*: read off the edge where the artwork meets the page, so that when
 * the page is filled with it the art has no border — the image does not sit
 * on the page, it runs out into it. That is the whole effect, and it is why
 * the colour is sampled at the edges and nowhere else. iTunes 11 put the
 * album art at the right of a panel and the colour to its left, and sampled
 * the left edge; a hero here melts into the page at its *foot*, so the foot
 * is what counts most (`HERO_EDGES`).
 *
 * ## The algorithm, as reverse-engineered from iTunes 11
 *
 *  1. **Crop the outer border** (`border`), so a thin frame, a JPEG's ringing
 *     at the image edge, or a one-pixel letterbox line is never the answer.
 *  2. **Sample the edges** — a band of each (`band`), weighted per edge.
 *  3. **Cluster** what was sampled by colour distance. iTunes compared sRGB
 *     channels at about a tenth of their range; this clusters in **Oklab**,
 *     where a distance is the same visible difference everywhere — in sRGB a
 *     tenth is a shade apart in the darks and invisible in the lights, which
 *     is exactly where an edge of key art tends to sit. `radius` is about four
 *     just-noticeable differences: "the same colour", allowing for grain.
 *  4. **The largest cluster is the key colour** — except that near-black and
 *     near-white yield to a real colour that is at least 30% as large, which
 *     is iTunes' own rule (`SLColorArt`'s `_findEdgeColor`): a black edge is
 *     more often a vignette or a letterbox than the picture's colour.
 *
 * The clustering is deterministic: pixels are counted into a 5-bit histogram
 * first, and clusters are seeded from the most populous bins down, so the
 * answer never depends on the order the pixels were read in.
 *
 * ## What it is measured on
 *
 * **Only the part of the image that is on screen** (`visibleRegion`). A 16:9
 * key art drawn into a square banner shows its middle; its left and right
 * edges are cropped away, and a colour read off them would be the colour of
 * something nobody can see. The hook passes the frame and the image's anchor,
 * and the edges sampled are the edges of the crop.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * Not `immersiveBackground` (`lib/immersive-color.ts`): that is Palette's
 * *dominant* colour of the whole picture. The key colour is **the page's own
 * colour** on the three pages that draw an Apple Music hero — one colour from
 * the top of the page to its foot, which darkens as the page is read
 * (`keyPage`) — toned for this app's dark room first, because Apple's own can
 * be white.
 *
 * Pure: no React Native and no `@/`, so `npm test` loads it.
