/**
 * How somebody else's logo — a platform's, a studio's — can be drawn straight
 * on this app's dark page, read from its pixels.
 *
 * Pure: no React Native and no network, so `npm test` covers it. The pixels
 * come from `measureLogoInk` (`lib/logo-luminance.ts`), which decodes a small
 * rendering of the logo in JavaScript.
 *
 * ## Why it is measured
 *
 * IGDB's logos are whatever was uploaded. Checked against the live catalogue:
 * PlayStation 4's is black ink cut out of nothing, which on a near-black page
 * is a hole; Windows' is blue on nothing and reads as it is; PlayStation 5's
 * is a white wordmark on an opaque black rectangle, which a silhouette would
 * turn into a blank block; the Switch 2's sits on opaque grey. IGDB's own
 * `alpha_channel` flag does not tell them apart — it says "no alpha" of
 * Windows' and Linux's, which are both cut out. So the pixels decide.
