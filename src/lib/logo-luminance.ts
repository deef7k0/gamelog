 *
 * The studio page draws a logo as it is when that ink holds 3:1 against the
 * page and as a light silhouette otherwise (`logoNeedsLightInk`) — which has to
 * be measured, because Commons' logos are drawn for white pages: FromSoftware's
 * is pure black and would vanish on the studio page's dark one.
 *
 * Decoded in JavaScript (`lib/png.ts`, and `jpeg-js` for the rare JPEG logo).
 * This was Skia's job, and the last one Skia had: a native library of 8–15 MB
 * per CPU architecture, in every APK, to read a few thousand pixels once per
 * studio. Measured once, when the logo is first resolved, and cached with it
 * for a month (`use-studio-logo`).
 *
 * ## A second, smaller download
 *
 * The page draws the 960px thumbnail; this reads the 250px one, which Commons
 * serves from the same path. That costs one extra request of ~3 KB per studio
 * per month, and saves decoding 300k pixels on the JS thread — it used to read
 * the drawn file out of expo-image's disk cache, which was right while Skia
 * decoded it natively and wrong once the decode is JavaScript.
 *
 * Every request carries the app's User-Agent: Wikimedia's media host refuses a
 * generic client with a 403.
