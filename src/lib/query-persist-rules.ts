 * What may be kept on the device between launches, and for how long.
 *
 * The pure half of `query-persist.ts` — which query, in what envelope, evicted
 * when — so `npm test` can hold it without AsyncStorage or React Native.
 *
 * ## The rule this implements
 *
 * A screen that has been seen once opens with what it showed last, and the
 * network overwrites it a moment later. That is SimpMusic's Home, read from its
 * source (`HomeRepositoryImpl.getMoodAndMomentsData`): "Serve the cached copy
 * first so the grid paints instantly; the network result is emitted right after
 * and overwrites it … a stale frame costs nothing while a spinner does."
 *
 * Here the cache is TanStack Query's, so the unit is a query: its key, its data
 * and when that data arrived. Everything else about a query — fetch status,
 * failure counts, an error — is this launch's business and is not written.
 */

/**
 * Bump when the shape of anything a query returns changes in a way an older
 * copy would break — a field renamed, an array that became an object.
 *
 * A row written under another version is dropped unread. Adding a field needs
 * no bump: every reader of server data already tolerates a missing one (see
 * CLAUDE.md, "The app can be a migration ahead of its database").
 *
 * 2: a game's `heroUrl` stopped being IGDB's first artwork, which was as often
 * an icon or a wordmark as key art (`lib/games/hero-art.ts`). Nothing about
 * the shape changed — but every saved game still named the old image, and its
 * page would have opened on a 128px icon blown up across the hero for the
 * second it takes the fresh record to arrive.
 *
 * 3: a collection's summary lost `mosaic` and gained `stack` — a field
 * renamed, which is the first case this note names — and the version was not
 * bumped with it. Every saved list of collections came back without the field
 * its tile maps over, so the first screen to draw one threw "cannot read
 * property 'map' of undefined" and landed on the error boundary; that emptied
 * the cache, which is why "Try again" worked. The owner met it on the first
 * launch after the change. **Adding a field needs no bump; renaming one is
 * removing one, and does.**
