/**
 * How a set of scores divides, as the owner's reference draws it (2026-10-21):
 * a row for 100, then one for each ten below it — 90–99 down to 0–9 — each a
 * bar as long as its count against the longest, the count beside it.
 *
 * ```text
 *    100    50  ▇▇▇
 *  90–99   139  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇
 *  80-89   176  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇
 *    …
 *    0-9    59  ▇▇▇▇
 * ```
 *
 * Drawn for a game — its Ratings card and its reviews sheet — and for a
 * person, on their profile. The reference paints each row its own colour; the
 * owner kept the app's three ("the colors remain the same, red yellow and
 * green"): a row is the colour of the score in its middle (`toneScore`), so
 * 70 and up is green, 45 to 69 amber, the rest red — the score ramp's own
 * edges, with 40–49 amber because its middle is.
 *
 * Counts are people's ratings, one each — a game's from every rating of it,
 * a person's from every game they rated. Pure; `npm test` covers it.
