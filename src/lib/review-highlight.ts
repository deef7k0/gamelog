 * Picking the part of a review that goes on its image — the owner's design
 * (2026-10-16), after Instagram's music slider rather than SimpMusic's list of
 * lines: the whole review is shown, a highlight sits over its first few words,
 * a tap moves it to one whole word, and holding an end and dragging stretches
 * or shrinks it — until the card is full, where it stops. Line breaks are kept,
 * on the screen and on the card.
 *
 * Every word is laid out here, from Poppins' advance widths, so the screen
 * knows where each one is: a finger's position is a word without asking the
 * platform, and the highlight and its two ends are drawn exactly round it.
 *
 * Pure: `review-highlight.test.ts`.
