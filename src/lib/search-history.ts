 * passes through "el", "eld", "elde"… and every pause long enough to fire a
 * request would otherwise leave its own row. Exact de-duplication does not help:
 * those are all different strings.
 *
 * So adding a term drops any stored entry the new term *starts with*, in the
 * same scope. "elden ring" swallows "elden" and "eld", and the history ends up
 * holding the searches somebody meant rather than the keystrokes on the way to
 * them. Typing a genuinely shorter term later still keeps both, because the
 * longer one is not a prefix of it.
