/**
 * Material 3 dynamic colour (Monet), generated from one seed.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * The app's own five-tone ramp, which derived `page` / `card` / `elevated` /
 * `color` from a hue by restating it at fixed HSL saturation and lightness. That
 * worked, and it had two limits this does not: it produced exactly one accent
 * family (so there was no secondary or tertiary to reach for), and HSL lightness
 * is not perceptual — the same "L" reads as a different brightness at different
 * hues, which is why the old ramp needed per-role saturation tuning to look even
 * across the wheel. HCT is perceptually uniform, so tone 20 is *the same
 * lightness* whether the hue is yellow or indigo.
 *
 * ## Why the tones are read off the palettes rather than off the scheme
 *
 * `DynamicScheme` exposes every role as a getter (`scheme.surfaceContainer`),
 * and those getters implement whichever M3 spec version the library defaults to
 * — currently 2021, whose dark `surfaceContainer` is neutral tone **12**. The
 * table below asks for **20**. Rather than accept whatever the library's spec
 * revision happens to say this release, the scheme is built for its *palettes*
 * — which is where `TONAL_SPOT`'s chroma rules actually live — and every role
 * then reads an explicit tone off an explicit palette. That makes this file the
 * single statement of what the app's colours are, and makes the output stable
 * across library upgrades.
 *
 * ## Why TONAL_SPOT
 *
 * It is the Android system default and the least opinionated of the nine
 * variants: the primary palette keeps the seed's hue at a moderate chroma (36)
 * and the neutrals stay genuinely near-grey (chroma 6 / 8). `VIBRANT` and
 * `EXPRESSIVE` rotate the hue for secondary and tertiary, which is striking on a
 * launcher and wrong here — a game's page should be the colour of that game's
 * box art, not a harmony built around it.

 * artwork is *one object on the page* and the palette is the only thing carrying
 * the game's identity, so every one of those is too quiet — the result reads as
 * a grey app with a pastel button.
 *
 * **Primary tracks the seed's own chroma between a floor and a ceiling.** A
 * clamp rather than a constant, because the seeds are real measurements and they
 * differ enormously: Red Dead's red arrives at chroma 62, DOOM's at 80, a muted
 * warm cover at 30, a near-grey cover at 13. A constant would either wash out
 * the vivid ones or invent colour the muted ones never had. The floor (48) is
 * what stops a grey cover producing a grey button; the ceiling (72) is what
 * stops a neon one producing a fill that hurts.
 *
 * The neutrals roughly double, which is what tints the page and the cards toward
 * the game without making them coloured surfaces — `#291716` for Red Dead's red
 * rather than M3's near-grey `#231919`.
